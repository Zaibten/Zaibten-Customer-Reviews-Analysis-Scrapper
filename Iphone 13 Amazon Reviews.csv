Iphone from Apple as usual top in quality and experiance.

First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side,  so though it is very good in all aspects,  many people may find it very difficult to purchase .

Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.‚Ä¶.. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience

Not that good. Phone is handy and for me I doesn‚Äôt make sense as iPhone X and 15 looks similar and refresh rate too poor. They charged more but big theifs even their competitors are eager to fetch money from customers but not ready to give worth the money. Customers need to slowly have to reject these brands and btw last 14 years using Apple products but it is worst in the sense not much up gradation. iPhone 15 pro max even pathetic

Call recording , call pick up haptic , smart dial and many more little but verry important feature ..Many youtuber says there is no such use of dynamic island but listen to me it is verry usefull and looking cool tooPrice : obviously it's not value for money but it's far better than 13 and 14 launch price which is same . Although this time iPhone 15 far better than 15 pro

The BEST iPhone EVERRRRRRR! : iPhone 15 review after 2 weeks of continuous use
","
The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy.

1. Good display -‚Ä¢ Peak brightness is good and good visibility even in broad day light.‚Ä¢ Clarity of the picture is good.2. Excellent camera update -‚Ä¢ Portrait mode pictures are great.‚Ä¢ Resolution of the picture has improved and can see more details.3. Dynamic island -‚Ä¢ As a first time experience, it is exiting to see a separated put notch hanging and videos playing around it. Gotta see its uses in long run.4. USB - C‚Ä¢ Gives us option to use other android chargers when needed. Great relief for apple users. Don‚Äôt have to be extra careful while packing :-P5.

The device I almost lost within a week.
","
I had an interesting experience with the new model. The corners are noticeably curvier compared to the previous version, making the device sleeker. Unfortunately, the phone slipped out of my pant pocket while I was in an auto, and I only noticed after returning home. I quickly grabbed my iPad, locked my device, and used the ‚ÄòFind My‚Äô app to track down my phone. Thankfully, it ended up in the hands of someone who wasn‚Äôt very tech-savvy and couldn‚Äôt figure out how to turn it off using the key combination. This allowed me to successfully locate and retrieve my device. Overall, it was quite an adventure. Now I slapped a rubber case on it and it‚Äôs not going anywhere.

If you don‚Äôt like using big sized phone , go for it. One day battery life for above average use. Camera is good. Video is excellent, call reception is excellent, screen is really smooth ( if u have never used 120hz). Gaming is smooth although I won‚Äôt recommend for long and heavy gaming as it would drain the battery. Charging is quick. If you use 20WT APPLE power adapter then you would notice heat while charging. Then goes back normal after getting charged above 70%. In hand feel of the phone is really good. Base model itself feels more premium like pro models. Type c is really a good addition as it creates more functionality. Screen is really bright and visible even under direct sunlight. This is by far the best upgrade of base model iPhone in years. GO FOR IT!

Phone is overall a beast specially in terms of battery and camera it has improved a lot, display is also brighter compared to the old ones, a little upgrade in processor too and dynamic island is an add on to it which looks cool and will give you feel of a pro.There is nothing much difference between 60 and 120 hrtz considering the price because 60 hrtz of an iphone is much smoother than a android one.Im using this device from few days and only problem im facing that this phone is heating specially when you are updating to new ios so dont worry it happens when you update to newer ios.im Using 20 watt charger and its performing very well to my phone with little warm feeling which is normal due to fast charging.Dont think too much about battery health because you have spend a lot for this tech so use it without anxiety to its highest capacity.

The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade with improvements across the board. The design is sleek, the display is gorgeous, and the performance is top-notch. The camera takes stunning photos, and iOS 17 offers some exciting new features. While there are a few minor shortcomings, the overall experience is undeniably impressive.

I was using iPhone 13 and switching to 15 was a good choice I guess! The phone have  better camera than 13 as the lens are bigger with more megapixels also the Dynamic Island makes it more fun and engaging and the gaming experience is pretty smooth and amazing as it‚Äôs having iPhone 14 Pro Max chipset.

When I preordered to Amazon I will not sure about how my product get to me in what condition but Amazon did great work and if you have a budget of 80k then you should go for iPhone I will recommend you to purchase it without a blink because You will not get this type of iPhone specification in other iPhone but tbh I will say 60hz hurts to me because in this price you will get 144hz type display but iPhone is lit and the camera quality this time in non pro model is excellent compare to the past year I phone and the chipset A16 bionic is üí•üí• and I am not a gamer but I will say because I will play 2 or 3 games of BGMI in this phone and fps gyroscope handling and battery consumption is excellent and game not render in hot spot place also so if you think buy iPhone go for this

First iphone and not up to the mark
","
After using for two days, here's what I found out. First, Android is way better when it comes to selfies. I'm literally looking for Xiaomi 13 pro to drop and I'll just jump for it. Iphone 15 is good when it comes to back camera, which is just unparalleled, with it's spectacular details and original color retention. However, the selfie camera is much worse, it catches all the blemishes on your face and makes you look uglier. Sound quality is superb, without a doubt. Scrolling through the phone is a bit slow compared to other phones, because of the 60hz, but it's still bearable. Voice calling sound is good and clear. USB c is a good thing which at least allowed me to charge on a different charger because I didn't have Apple charger right away. The height of Iphone 15 and plus is funny because they have almost all the same thing just height is bigger for plus. Also, I paid 3k more on this platform because the next day the price dropped on Amazon. At the end of the day, iphone is good, but Android always wins, no matter what.

Go for this without a doubt instead of the 14 pro or previous ones. The camera is really the better one than all the previous versions. If you‚Äôre willing to give up on Always On Display, High Refresh Rates (iOS is optimised and you won‚Äôt feel any difference if you‚Äôve never used a phone with high refresh rates.) and a Macro Lens then this is the one. The feel in hand is also amazing, you wouldn‚Äôt know unless you‚Äôve held one. Type c is also a game-changer than all the previous versions.
