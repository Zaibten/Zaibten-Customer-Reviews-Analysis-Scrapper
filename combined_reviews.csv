It‚Äôs perfect!
","
I did have my doubts buying it online but this was great. Amazon is legitimate and reliable.The display quality is superb. It feels smooth!Phone doesn‚Äôt really heat up. Just when it‚Äôs charging which is totally normal. (Try charging your phone without a cover/case.)The phone doesn‚Äôt not hang or lag. Like I said earlier, it‚Äôs smooth!The performance is truly impressive. Once I transferred my data(which was so easy) I didn‚Äôt even have to use my old phone.The camera quality is great. The videos are clear and crisp. The photos are truly stunning. And there are so many settings for you to explore.Coming from an android user, using a phone has never been better! This is my 2nd phone and I‚Äôm really glad it is an iPhone. The experience is amazing.So summing up, this is a great purchase and worth the price.

Better choice even in 2024 If budget @40k‚Ä¶ Value For Money üí∞üëç

First of all Thanks to Amazon and the seller Darshitha Ezone for this Genuine product. I Got this one @41.5k And at that price it was a better option. I compared IPhone 13 With Samsung s23 and both are premium flagship phones and if u love  Android then go with S23  at the same price or Go with Iqoo Flagship series and If u want to move IOS then Go with 13 or 16. I‚Äôm Moving from Android (Iqoo Neo 6) to IPhone 13, and since 1yr Im a IPad user so I‚Äôm habituated to IOS so it‚Äôs not a big deal for me. And coming to my Unboxing experience‚Ä¶Yeah It was very good ‚Ä¶Brand new IPhone , Great performance, Great Display, Best Haptics and Battery as expected not so long lasting as android but can easily give A day Backup on normal usage, If u use 5g continuously so More Data usage and battery backup will be around 4hrs SOT and yeah in the initial device setup hours any mobile becomes warm and now no such heating issues and back camera is awesome but front cam is still better in my Iqoo Neo6 ‚Ä¶anyone thinking 13 and 14 ‚Ä¶No difference at all but compared with 15 yeah there are some differences but not major ones and actually 15 has some major heating issues, Battery backup issues , Camera issues so don‚Äôt go with 15, if u really want Newer series go with iPhone 16 as cameras , Design,AI, Chip and other upgrades are there. But if u just want an iPhone go with 13 or 14 And actually the build quality is slightly better and Give premium feel in 13 and 14 series which is missing in 15 series. Actually I Bought this to use for 1 yr after that I‚Äôll upgrade to Newer iPhone series.Final verdict :: If u just want an iPhone then 13 or 14 is still a good choose for max 3 yrs usage.Beware of The Sellers‚Ä¶Go through their Ratings and Reviews and then only make an order.

Stunning Design and a Beautiful Pink!
","
I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I‚Äôve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous‚Äîit's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you‚Äôd expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it‚Äôs almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, ‚ÄúWelcome to the 21st century!‚ÄùThe display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It‚Äôs crazy how much has changed‚Äîface ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you‚Äôre thinking about upgrading, especially if you‚Äôre coming from a much older model like I was, don‚Äôt hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!

This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.

Loved it

Bought as a gift for my sister, coming down to cons, 60hz and slow charging are the only two things that are bad, but at 38k i would say the phone is fantastic, perfect size, premium, grt camera, grt display quality, grt sound and haptics, ticks all the boxes, a bit heavy in weight though. The battery also lasts a day easily. Heats a bit so if you are a games, pls invest in a cooling pad and buy the plus variant only. All in all can buy, its a future proof device.

Best I phone in this segment. üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è

Yes! Finally got mine hand's on brand new I phone 13, so talking about my experience with I phone is first I was using a I phone se 2020, it was an upgrade from se 2020 to I phone 13, unfortunately most of you guys must be confused in 13/14 here's I'll clear your most of the doubt in short span of words. So talking about the major difference in 13/14 is1- 14 has 6 GB of ram / 13 has 4gbAlthough the optimisation is top-notch in I phones so that won't effect you overall in multi tasking.2- 14 has a little bit of camera change internally such as it can record 4k 30fps in cinematic mode 13 can do 1080p @30fps that's all.3- 14 has a core gpu +1 that's it!Both has a 15 bionic flagship chipsetBoth has same battery life same battery screen on time same size same phone cover can be fit identically to eachother.13 has slightly more battery life than 14 I have watched many videos on YouTube. Its always last 20/25min more because of Ram and management optimisation less load on GPU overall.Using it from few days'great experience always check your phone and do get checked on Apple official website using the serial numbers and all for genuine authentication.Display is top-notchOutdoor viability is awesome.The 60hz display doesn't feel slow at all it's definitely a good way of optimisation in display as well.The touch response is smooth and lag free.Sound the stereo speakers are soooo loud the music has good and cristal clear sound.Great I phone for greater user experience.Function and management optimisation are great.Don't buy 14 and waste your more money about 10k rather then go with 13 and buy a good case and screen guard for that price you will save more and get additional accesories for new phone!!!I'm using a ringke case as it has military grade drop protection and I'm using ringke case from 4 year's.Go for it guys!!Thank you!!

First of all the product is very good this is my first time buying an iPhone and it feels nice and premium the camera quality is top notch however this is my first few days of using it and I am loving it however I want to talk about the delivery process which was worst I have ordered two phones on the same day and it showed that the products will get delivered in the same day one of the products got deli On the same day and the other one was not delivered and when I called the customer care they said that due to heavy rain your parcel will be deli The next day. On the next day I have called customer care in the morning and they gave me the number of the delivery person and he said that he didn‚Äôt have my parcel after that the whole de this process was going on I was calling the custom Care and every person was saying different thing about my product and one of few people were very rude. Also at the last moment they said that my delivery agent has been changed and many more things. Finally after 10 pm my product got delivered. The overall experience Was very frustrating and unprofessional

Flare on camera
","
Overall, the quality of the iPhone is impressive. The display is crisp, and the sound quality is excellent. The phone runs smoothly with no lag, hang or performance issues.However, I noticed a significant issue with the camera. When pointing it toward a light source, there is too much lens flare, and ghosting often occurs in photos. This is a flaw that Apple should definitely work on.Additionally, the charging speed could be improved, as it feels slower than expected.In summary, while the phone excels in performance and build quality, the camera's flare problem needs attention.

I guess no one was ever able to articulate what an iPhone really is
","
A phone that cost 60,000 to even over a lakh rupee appeared to be a little bit of a far-fetched Idea not long ago, when friends and family were buying iPhones. I was wondering what‚Äôs so special about this phone, I asked for different opinions, checked videos, but nobody ever clearly encapsulated the idea of an iPhone.Now that I am holding one, I can confidently say that an iPhone is not just about its great camera, or it‚Äôs great looks, an iPhone is an experience, of course, it clicks great pictures, there is nothing much to complain about the battery, but what stands out for me is the fact that an iPhone is about care. Someone, and that someone being Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, cared enough to create great products. So much that when you hold it in your hands, you don‚Äôt just feel like you‚Äôre holding a piece of technology, but rather a helpful companion that is there to help you share and communicate in ways that make it seem almost like an art. To me, an iPhone gives wings to my creative expression and that makes it what it is, an iPhone is an ally for the creative spirit in you.

iphone and amazon app is good. but experience with delivery agent and exchange was worst .
","
iphone product is good. but i had a very bad experience with the exchange and delivery process. i have exchanged a new phone but the delivery agent refused to do the diagnostic check for the phone once again. as i had new phone just a month back purchased the exchange process was not done propoerly . Amazon should consider such activities seriously. the delivery agent giving silly reasons and asking us to pay the extra money. i had to pay 1680 rs more as the delivery agent did not follow the exchange diagnotic check on rabbit exchange app properly. he purposely did the diagnostic to get the issue and the app showed with defect in charging port and when asked for redo the diagnostic he refused. i showed him the phone connected with charger and the phone was chargning. Amazon itself can check the exchanged phone once agai  for the condition. i have no problem with iphone nor amazon , but the delivery persons knowledge is worst and pathetic experience there is no point to echange a new phone for such low price as the app showed 5600 rs for a exhange but the delivery guy asked me to pay 1680 more this exchange offer is a scam .

Iphone 13
","
After purchasing the iPhone 13, I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here‚Äôs a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It‚Äôs clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareIOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features. Whether it‚Äôs the stunning display, powerful camera system, or impressive battery life, every aspect of this phone feels well-thought-out and polished. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience.

I have been using the phone for the last 10 days. There's a little heating that occurs during charging and over using. Other than this , the phone looks premium. The thing that makes iphone different from android is that one doesn't need to stick around with the phone much because iphone I think has restricted features compared to android.

Got for Best Price(Great Indian Sale) And On time secure delivery
","
After reviewing multiple you tube video's to finalize between Iphone 13, Samsung 23 and Pixel 8, finally decided on Iphone 13, one of the reason is to upgrade to newer version of iPhone after couple of years.  Got for best price on Amazon in Great Indian Sale (39999/- opted for no cost EMI for 12 months otherwise would have got extra 2k benefit).Was worrying about delivery, as heard about multiple frauds, but was very satisfied after receiving delivery, the reason is now Amazon is delivering the products in secure cover with unique id, delivery OTP and sending delivery OTP, pocket unique id to user mobile, so that they can verify before taking the delivery. Delivery was fast, received on 2nd day of purchase. Was using android earlier but it was easy to move all apps from Android to IOS using the Apple provided App.Mobile is good as reviewed by many users, only minor concern is battery capacity, for which I was ready.

Alright guys, i bought this phone on great indian festive sale. I goot it for 37500 after card discount and no cost emi discount.I switched from android to apple just for camera. No doubt camera is gud but iphone lacks in performance overall. It's very slow yrr. I just used nothing phone 2a and it has blown my mind guys, literally that phone is outstanding. Nothing phone 2a selfie camera is even much better then iphone, trust me when i say this. I didn't bought nothing 2a cuz it's front camera is not like iphone. Rest everything on that phone is much better and much faster then iphone. If u are an android user then u won't like iphone for sure. I'm just gonna keep iphone for pictures, nothing else. Nothing phone was available at 20k after discount on flpkrt. I should've opted for that but bought iphone cuz i wanted to for soo long and it's my last iphone i think, i won't buy another again if there will be no improvement in iphone. It's ducking slow and lack in a lot of featuresü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èGiving 3 stars just for camera.

iPhone 15 A solid upgrade and value for money
","
DesignOne of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14. DisplayThe iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.PerformanceThe iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.CameraThe iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.Battery lifeThe iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge.  Overall  The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.ProsNew design with rounded edgesMore powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 proNew 48-megapixel main cameraBrighter display with upto 2000 nits brightnessUSB C can be used for anythingDynamic IslandCons No 120hz display No Macro photography

Iphone from Apple as usual top in quality and experiance.

First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side,  so though it is very good in all aspects,  many people may find it very difficult to purchase .

iPhone XR to iPhone 15
","
Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.‚Ä¶.. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience

Sound quality is very good. Performance is good and transfer of data from my old iPhone happened very fast. Software update was completed immediately after starting the phone . Only problem is that the charging cable is different and it doesn‚Äôt fit into USB port, so one must have an adapter or order one along with the iPhone.

Everyone know about pros , let's only talk about consBattery : worst than I expect . Many says it is IOS 17 behind poor battery life .

Call recording , call pick up haptic , smart dial and many more little but verry important feature ..Many youtuber says there is no such use of dynamic island but listen to me it is verry usefull and looking cool tooPrice : obviously it's not value for money but it's far better than 13 and 14 launch price which is same . Although this time iPhone 15 far better than 15 pro

The BEST iPhone EVERRRRRRR! : iPhone 15 review after 2 weeks of continuous use
","
The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy.

Dynamic island -‚Ä¢ As a first time experience, it is exiting to see a separated put notch hanging and videos playing around it. Gotta see its uses in long run.4. USB - C‚Ä¢ Gives us option to use other android chargers when needed. Great relief for apple users. Don‚Äôt have to be extra careful while packing :-P5.

I had an interesting experience with the new model. The corners are noticeably curvier compared to the previous version, making the device sleeker. Unfortunately, the phone slipped out of my pant pocket while I was in an auto, and I only noticed after returning home. I quickly grabbed my iPad, locked my device, and used the ‚ÄòFind My‚Äô app to track down my phone. Thankfully, it ended up in the hands of someone who wasn‚Äôt very tech-savvy and couldn‚Äôt figure out how to turn it off using the key combination. This allowed me to successfully locate and retrieve my device. Overall, it was quite an adventure. Now I slapped a rubber case on it and it‚Äôs not going anywhere.

If you don‚Äôt like using big sized phone , go for it. One day battery life for above average use. Camera is good. Video is excellent, call reception is excellent, screen is really smooth ( if u have never used 120hz). Gaming is smooth although I won‚Äôt recommend for long and heavy gaming as it would drain the battery. Charging is quick. If you use 20WT APPLE power adapter then you would notice heat while charging. Then goes back normal after getting charged above 70%. In hand feel of the phone is really good. Base model itself feels more premium like pro models. Type c is really a good addition as it creates more functionality. Screen is really bright and visible even under direct sunlight. This is by far the best upgrade of base model iPhone in years. GO FOR IT!

Phone is overall a beast specially in terms of battery and camera it has improved a lot, display is also brighter compared to the old ones, a little upgrade in processor too and dynamic island is an add on to it which looks cool and will give you feel of a pro.There is nothing much difference between 60 and 120 hrtz considering the price because 60 hrtz of an iphone is much smoother than a android one.Im using this device from few days and only problem im facing that this phone is heating specially when you are updating to new IOS so dont worry it happens when you update to newer IOS.im Using 20 watt charger and its performing very well to my phone with little warm feeling which is normal due to fast charging.Dont think too much about battery health because you have spend a lot for this tech so use it without anxiety to its highest capacity.

The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade with improvements across the board. The design is sleek, the display is gorgeous, and the performance is top-notch. The camera takes stunning photos, and IOS 17 offers some exciting new features. While there are a few minor shortcomings, the overall experience is undeniably impressive.

I was using iPhone 13 and switching to 15 was a good choice I guess!

When I preordered to Amazon I will not sure about how my product get to me in what condition but Amazon did great work and if you have a budget of 80k then you should go for iPhone I will recommend you to purchase it without a blink because You will not get this type of iPhone specification in other iPhone but tbh I will say 60hz hurts to me because in this price you will get 144hz type display but iPhone is lit and the camera quality this time in non pro model is excellent compare to the past year I phone and the chipset A16 bionic is üí•üí• and I am not a gamer but I will say because I will play 2 or 3 games of BGMI in this phone and fps gyroscope handling and battery consumption is excellent and game not render in hot spot place also so if you think buy iPhone go for this

First iphone and not up to the mark
","
After using for two days, here's what I found out. First, Android is way better when it comes to selfies. I'm literally looking for Xiaomi 13 pro to drop and I'll just jump for it. Iphone 15 is good when it comes to back camera, which is just unparalleled, with it's spectacular details and original color retention. However, the selfie camera is much worse, it catches all the blemishes on your face and makes you look uglier. Sound quality is superb, without a doubt. Scrolling through the phone is a bit slow compared to other phones, because of the 60hz, but it's still bearable. Voice calling sound is good and clear. USB c is a good thing which at least allowed me to charge on a different charger because I didn't have Apple charger right away. The height of Iphone 15 and plus is funny because they have almost all the same thing just height is bigger for plus. Also, I paid 3k more on this platform because the next day the price dropped on Amazon. At the end of the day, iphone is good, but Android always wins, no matter what.

Go for this without a doubt instead of the 14 pro or previous ones. The camera is really the better one than all the previous versions. If you‚Äôre willing to give up on Always On Display, High Refresh Rates (IOS is optimised and you won‚Äôt feel any difference if you‚Äôve never used a phone with high refresh rates.) and a Macro Lens then this is the one. The feel in hand is also amazing, you wouldn‚Äôt know unless you‚Äôve held one. Type c is also a game-changer than all the previous versions.

iPhone 15 A solid upgrade and value for money
","
DesignOne of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14. DisplayThe iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.PerformanceThe iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.CameraThe iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.Battery lifeThe iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge.

Iphone from Apple as usual top in quality and experiance.
","
First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side,  so though it is very good in all aspects,  many people may find it very difficult to purchase .

iPhone XR to iPhone 15
","
Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.‚Ä¶.. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience

Everyone know about pros , let's only talk about consBattery : worst than I expect . Many says it is IOS 17 behind poor battery life .

Call recording , call pick up haptic , smart dial and many more little but verry important feature ..Many youtuber says there is no such use of dynamic island but listen to me it is verry usefull and looking cool tooPrice : obviously it's not value for money but it's far better than 13 and 14 launch price which is same . Although this time iPhone 15 far better than 15 pro

The BEST iPhone EVERRRRRRR! : iPhone 15 review after 2 weeks of continuous use
","
The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy.

Dynamic island -‚Ä¢ As a first time experience, it is exiting to see a separated put notch hanging and videos playing around it. Gotta see its uses in long run.4. USB - C‚Ä¢ Gives us option to use other android chargers when needed. Great relief for apple users. Don‚Äôt have to be extra careful while packing :-P5.

I had an interesting experience with the new model. The corners are noticeably curvier compared to the previous version, making the device sleeker. Unfortunately, the phone slipped out of my pant pocket while I was in an auto, and I only noticed after returning home. I quickly grabbed my iPad, locked my device, and used the ‚ÄòFind My‚Äô app to track down my phone. Thankfully, it ended up in the hands of someone who wasn‚Äôt very tech-savvy and couldn‚Äôt figure out how to turn it off using the key combination. This allowed me to successfully locate and retrieve my device. Overall, it was quite an adventure. Now I slapped a rubber case on it and it‚Äôs not going anywhere.

If you don‚Äôt like using big sized phone , go for it. One day battery life for above average use. Camera is good. Video is excellent, call reception is excellent, screen is really smooth ( if u have never used 120hz). Gaming is smooth although I won‚Äôt recommend for long and heavy gaming as it would drain the battery. Charging is quick. If you use 20WT APPLE power adapter then you would notice heat while charging. Then goes back normal after getting charged above 70%. In hand feel of the phone is really good. Base model itself feels more premium like pro models. Type c is really a good addition as it creates more functionality. Screen is really bright and visible even under direct sunlight. This is by far the best upgrade of base model iPhone in years. GO FOR IT!

Phone is overall a beast specially in terms of battery and camera it has improved a lot, display is also brighter compared to the old ones, a little upgrade in processor too and dynamic island is an add on to it which looks cool and will give you feel of a pro.There is nothing much difference between 60 and 120 hrtz considering the price because 60 hrtz of an iphone is much smoother than a android one.Im using this device from few days and only problem im facing that this phone is heating specially when you are updating to new IOS so dont worry it happens when you update to newer IOS.im Using 20 watt charger and its performing very well to my phone with little warm feeling which is normal due to fast charging.Dont think too much about battery health because you have spend a lot for this tech so use it without anxiety to its highest capacity.

I switched from 13 to 15
","
I was using iPhone 13 and switching to 15 was a good choice I guess! The phone have  better camera than 13 as the lens are bigger with more megapixels also the Dynamic Island makes it more fun and engaging and the gaming experience is pretty smooth and amazing as it‚Äôs having iPhone 14 Pro Max chipset.

When I preordered to Amazon I will not sure about how my product get to me in what condition but Amazon did great work and if you have a budget of 80k then you should go for iPhone I will recommend you to purchase it without a blink because You will not get this type of iPhone specification in other iPhone but tbh I will say 60hz hurts to me because in this price you will get 144hz type display but iPhone is lit and the camera quality this time in non pro model is excellent compare to the past year I phone and the chipset A16 bionic is üí•üí• and I am not a gamer but I will say because I will play 2 or 3 games of BGMI in this phone and fps gyroscope handling and battery consumption is excellent and game not render in hot spot place also so if you think buy iPhone go for this

First iphone and not up to the mark
","
After using for two days, here's what I found out. First, Android is way better when it comes to selfies. I'm literally looking for Xiaomi 13 pro to drop and I'll just jump for it. Iphone 15 is good when it comes to back camera, which is just unparalleled, with it's spectacular details and original color retention. However, the selfie camera is much worse, it catches all the blemishes on your face and makes you look uglier. Sound quality is superb, without a doubt. Scrolling through the phone is a bit slow compared to other phones, because of the 60hz, but it's still bearable. Voice calling sound is good and clear. USB c is a good thing which at least allowed me to charge on a different charger because I didn't have Apple charger right away. The height of Iphone 15 and plus is funny because they have almost all the same thing just height is bigger for plus. Also, I paid 3k more on this platform because the next day the price dropped on Amazon. At the end of the day, iphone is good, but Android always wins, no matter what.

Go for this without a doubt instead of the 14 pro or previous ones. The camera is really the better one than all the previous versions. If you‚Äôre willing to give up on Always On Display, High Refresh Rates (IOS is optimised and you won‚Äôt feel any difference if you‚Äôve never used a phone with high refresh rates.) and a Macro Lens then this is the one. The feel in hand is also amazing, you wouldn‚Äôt know unless you‚Äôve held one. Type c is also a game-changer than all the previous versions.

6 months of usage and this device never disappointed me.Pros -No lagNo heatButter smooth game play2x portrait photography is so goodUser friendlyBright displayHuge display where you can watch your series movies with hdr clarity.Very good speakers.Good front camExcellent battery with great charging speed. The backup is so good you could carry this phone for two days with lite usage without charging.Excellent Performance.Hardware appearance goodVery good build quality ( I dropped it 7 times, no damage noticed)Comes with an excellent quality screen gaurd.I bought red colour of this phone , but I find the black colour looks so good.Summary - this phone never troubles ne or doesn't even give me any thoughts of buying an another. The battery is the best thing I like about this phone as this phone never runs out.Cons -Only Camera - when compared to premium phones it has best camera for the price. But sometimes I think of buying more better camera phone as this camera is just ok and not premium.Go for it if you like an all-rounder phone which doesn't troubles you.

After one week of heavy usage
","
Pros :-1. Performance - I used this device for 14 hours on a day with 8 hours gaming, but device did not heat up or show any stress sign. I compared its performance with a Moto edge 40 that I have, and I can see the stark difference.  This phone is quite fast2. Battery - Battery lasts 1 day easily and with fast charging device gets fully charged in under 30 mins3. Camera - Decent camera, I wouldn't say the best but good for night photography and supermoon modeCons :-1. Build Quality- Phone feels a bit cheap compared to its price and the transparent cover also feels cheap. The leather back is much of worse quality compared to Moto2. Bloatwares - At this price I do not expect such bloatwares and too many advertisements3. Features- Some features don't work as expected like gesture calling features. And Also the double click to on flashlight is quite slowAlso they abruptly removed the Youtube background use feature with an update, so it does not work anymore.

Got this amazing beast in 26k with exchange offer and bank offer first of all it looks amazing üòç, unique leather design feels very premium and amazing in hand,Camera: very good camera with raw image processing and after image processing is really good,Battery: im using it from 100% and it last more than a day i trust me im a heavy user i played games for 3 hours continuously and battery came to 65% only,Gaming: slightly heating issue but it doesn't compromise on performance even when heated,120 fps and gaming mode features are just amazing it allows you to enhance the touch response rate and sensitivity of the perticular screen area for gaming like joystick,Over-all a best smartphone for this budget but if you have budget and you can get iqoo 12 then why notüòÅ that is a monster

Received Charging Adapter & Cable along with Sim Ejector & reading manuals.If you want to know whether BGMI runs smoothly or not, it definitely does with 90fps gaming. Doesn't lag on hot drops.8+8GB of RAM & 128GB of internal memory. No space for external memory. 120Watt Charging. Charge lasts around 6hrs. of intensive gaming & normal usage should last 1.5 days. Takes less than 30mins to charge fully. Camera is not the best but I would rate it 7/10. It's a gaming powerhouse so it won't disappoint you performance wise. Cost me ‚Çπ30.5K and got it delivered in 2 days. The speakers are above average. Dual speakers. Not the loudest. And doesn't have a port for 3.5mm jack.

Supercomputing Chip Q1.My openion: The best processor under this price range.It can  handle almost very hard situations easily.Taking  about the super computing chip,done a great  thing.Those game lovers definitely love this  phone(tried bgmi-90fps..... awesome feedback)Design:  1.Slim phone  2.Dual tone vegan leather finish(which is nice)  3.Body frame is plastic(Not metal--Disapointed)  4.Given IR blaster, which is also niceDisplay:  1.Ultra-narrow bezels are just 0.15 cm.  2.1.5K 144 Hz LTPO AMOLED Display(it's a great thing  and feels good.Dynamic refreh rate from 0 to  120Hz.144Hz refresh rate obtained in gaming scenario)  3.452 PPI Pixel density,6.78 -inch (17.22 cm) flat screen  having 3000nits peak brightness.2000 Hz Instant Touch  Sampling Rate.  4.wet touch technology which is good and effective in  many scenarIOS,pulse width modulation for eye  protection.Display is totally very good.(Suggestion..Better with 2K disply‚ò∫Ô∏è).Battery:  1.5160 mAh Massive Battery.Which easily last a day for  light usage upto 1 and half day.  2.120W Flash charge Charging time 25 to 100 approax 20  to 30mnts Varies according temparature of the phone  and chrging conditions.Camera:(squircle cam)  1.50 MP IMX920 Night Vision Camera.Which is good and  gives better portrait shots.Editing options are also good.  2. 8 MP Ultra Wide-Angle Camera.(It's not good as much as  I expected.Need upgrade..Only two cam present macro is  absent which absolutely excellent).  3.Video quality is great 8K in Day light and 4K  at night.  4.16MP Front camera..I am not a selfie lover But in my  openion it's not upto the mark. Could be better.Finger print scanner:  It's a decent optical fingerprint scanner working fast  and accurate.costomisation, animation are also good.Cooling system:  6K Vapour chamber liquid cooling system which is a dual  layer metal mesh.It's good and effective. some time  taking so much time to cool, while cooling manually  from iManager it's cooling fast.Could be more sensitive.Operating System:  Funtouch OS 14 Based on android 14  ‚Ä¢ I am first time on this funtouch OS.I really like it and  Minimal bloatwares.Only problems with the notification with V app store must be manually disabledpros:  1.Excellent Hardware performance.  2.Great Display  3.Good main camera(especially portrait shots)-normal skin  toning and small exposure is also there...Some of them  likes that some Not.  4.Decent software  5.Best Battery backup  6.Game changer  7.Great Charging.  An all-rounder under this price rangeCons:  1.Ultrawide camera....Much disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è  2.V-Appstoreüò°Phased issue:At this time while enabling preferred 5g most of the time incoming call is not connecting.I Don't think so it's the problem with the phones network it's the issue with the sim tower(if 5g is all around Hope it will definitely okey)Hopes my openion and review will help someone to decide whether this phone suits with their usage or not..I personally recommend this phone for mad game lovers and hardcore users.. Further updates will definitely add with this review..Thanks..

Some Great, some good and some disappointment.
","
Review after 45 days-PROS-‚úì‚úì(The Good)Display:- Best part of the device is the display.. it's stunning flagship level either you watch photo or video on it. Got very Brighter and Deep blacks are üî• visual enhancement and MEMC make it more convenient üî•plays 4k HDR video better than its compititions.Processor and processing:- In this category i can call it a flagship killer. Literally it's a monster .It handles everything like champ and IQOO's tuning with 8Gen 2 is just awesome . It's best optimised processor under 45K devices. I run 1 native Camera app, with 2 Gcam app capturing photos simultaneously with a photo editor editing  with Instagram, Facebook, Twitter open...and it handles everything with ease. Well done Iqoo. Fully Paisa wasool.Camera:- IMX920 is lit üî•üî• sensor is so so capable. Photos coming out of it is gorgeous... Very crisp and tons of details. It doesn't boost sky colour like others and captures 90% true to life type yet little vivid and crisp Iqoo style photo. Night mode is the best package. Captures lots of details in even in less light. Almost no noise in night. Iqoo and vivos night mode are industry best, no one can beat.Ultrawide:- firstly it's little disappointing to have a 8 mp sensor with 50 mp. But good tuning... captures good photos with decent dynamic range. Obviously better than some 12 mp ultrawides. Ofcourse lacks details as 8 mp yet good specially in daylight.Selfie cam- it's a decent camera. Got better after update. But lacks night mode and 4k recording.‚úìDecent:- haptics are decent. Set haptics settings high to get better experience. it's medium in default.Sound is decent too... But Dolby Atmos would have been great. Refresh rate is very well optimised..Battery üîã:- it's good battery despite being a performance centric phone. Depends on uses. I'm getting continuous  6h 30 min -7 h SOT with 20% battery left.*Here is a battery saving tips - Never charge above 90% and below 20%. In night Use dark theme when use device less and dark amoled wallpapers which will save idle draining. Turn off auto brightness. Select Network mode to 4G if 5G isn't necessary. 5G drains battery most. Keep device in cool temperature while charging and using. Follow these You will get better experience for sure.√ó√óConsUI:- software experience is the main villain.... horrible experience sometimes... Ex-while playing 4K videos on YouTube crashing after 5min everytime. Where other UI improving rapidly IQOO should be attentive to it's UI polishing.*Update -Regarding app crashing, IQOO addressed the problem with recent software update.Heating:- it's beginning of summer and Phone does heat up with uses. Sometimes it's a bit high though it's not overheating. Device is usable because of plastic frame. I think it's because of -IQOO unlocked full potential of 8Gen2 with dedicated Q1 chip. Not sure of the working of Cooling system. In brief - Yes, device has heating issue.So, use and charge device in cool environment otherwise it will impact the battery life.Design:-design is subjective but it is something that stopping it to be called flagship killer...IQOO should use Better quality vegan leather atleast.

Not for Gamers (BGMI) or 4 finger players
","
**Pros....Everything is on the phone is alright...Bgmi or big apps open very fast and run smoothly... Camera is very good...No issues for non gamers... battery charged very first and back up is also good...**Cons....No 3.5 mm Jack socket..So when I connect my ear phone by type C to 3.5 mm Jack when playing BGMI, I can't place my right hand properly although I have big palm...then I rotate the phone and it's better than previous but game is minimising by accidental touch on bottom ..which is not acceptable although now I have noticed a bit improvement.....If no head phone jack given then plz place type C port on Side, not in bottom...No video posted in YouTube regarding this problem.....UI is not up to the mark but manageable...A bit heating issue noticed, I hope it will be manageable during summer..Otherwise everything is alright...3 star given because of the highlights that it's a gaming phone but it's not for that particular issue...otherwise would have given 4 star..

Camera is awesome compared to other phone at this budget imx sensor works excellent minor details also captures perfect.Coming to the battery I play games more so for me I have to charge twice a day but for normal usage 2 day life at second even charge was 43 excellent battery.And for gamers it's an awesome phone no words the features the camera the mic excellent.One disadvantage is what I have faced is the above screen there is a gap Idk whether the sensor comes or not but that gap is more while cleaning the phone dust can go there and a small things like paper and cloths thread may stuck inside that gap as mine has been stuck so one disadvantage is there since I am using it from a month.Overall at this price excellent phone is provided by the iqoo.

In this price range a good phone with powerful processor, even camera is good, however zoom could have been better, #special mentioning to its night mode it is beast. One notable difference that I have seen is, its inbuilt quality, Phone doesn't feel premium at all in hands and it is very light though latter may be a personal choice. Overall its a good phone to buy, 30000-32000 rs may be a best deal for 128 gb varient. Phone might not be a flagship killer but certainly it brings embarrassment to flagship phones when we see the price differences.

My detailed review after 20 days of use
","
I got the glass back version of the Neo 9 Pro 8/128 gb (UFS 3.1) in black color @33k with card discountFirst I will start with the Cons of this device*****Cons*****1.Hole punch cutout for the front camera is too big and it really effects my usage watching multimedia.2.The back design isnt very good the camera are too big and not really proportional to the size of mobile and also they serve no purpose as they arent large sensors but a preference of design .3.Notifications and Software : Funtouch OS isnt very fun they are many notifications from V app store and the device also some with so much bloatware and doesnt even support disabiling for few apps.4.In landscape mode, there seems to be a glitch with notifications where they appear as if there's an additional notification stacked above them, even though there isn't one‚Äîit just leaves a blank space5.The included case and screen protector are very bad .The case gets a gas pocket at its back and comes off while using .It just increasing the waste .*****Pros*****1.Camera performance is very good and do try the Master B/W style in the back camera.The 2x potraits are very good when it gets the edge detection right.Go to the camera settings and turn on motion autofocus and potrait framing and explore more some of the features are off by default2.Battery and Charging is a win for me It takes close to 30mins to charge from 20% -30% to 100%3.Customization features are well built .I can customize Lock screen clock quick toggles on lockscreen Fingerprint sensor look and animation etc .Great customization features4.For me the glass back feels premium enough in hand.I feel its the better option to go with instead of plastic leathry red finish.I am satisfied with black one.5.Performance is very obivious comes with comes with 8gen2 chip no lags observed when using and i saw few issues with heating I have no such issues with my device .6.Software upsates:3yrs software and 4 years of security updates.VERDICT:I would recommed this under 35k for someone who is looking for a smartphone with great performance and a good camera and a decent overall experience .

Good hardware disappointing software
","
After around 3 weeks of usage, here are my ratings:- Look and Feel: 9.5/10 - The phone feels great in hand with excellent weight balance and a nice leather back.- Performance: 10/10 - Top-notch performance with no issues encountered.- Battery Backup: 8.5/10 - Good battery backup despite heavy usage (9 to 12 hours daily), with screen-on time ranging from 6 hours 30 minutes to 8 hours 47 minutes.- Display: 9/10 - The display is vibrant and satisfying.- Main Camera in Daylight: 8/10 - Decent performance in daylight conditions.- Ultrawide: 7/10 - Average performance in ultrawide shots.- Front Camera: 5/10 - Disappointing front camera performance.- Main Camera in Low Light: 5/10 - Main camera performance in low light is subpar.- Software: 4/10 - Despite purchasing the 12GB/256GB variant, the software experience leaves much to be desired. Coming from experiences with OnePlus, MI, Realme, Asus, and Pixel Experience custom ROMs, this phone's software fails to stand out positively. While it offers some customization options, in animations, it falls short in several areas.Firstly, the device comes loaded with bloatware that cannot be uninstalled even with ADB, cluttering the user experience. Most preinstalled apps are subpar, especially the dialer and launcher. The launcher lacks essential customization features like a bottom search bar, options to change icon size, or the number of icons in the app drawer. Additionally, it lacks intuitive gestures like double-tap to lock. If you use custom launcher it will block gesture to switch app and it will not work at all.The dialer experience is too cluttered in my opinion and it lacks feature like call announcement. Although it offers the option to record calls without notifications and enable auto call recording, it also have issues with Bluetooth connectivity. Furthermore, the apps demand excessive permissions, such as the IQOO account app requiring contact permissions despite offering no relevant functionality.Among the frustrating aspects is the Vappstore, one of the most intrusive apps I've encountered. While it allows the disabling of hot app and hot games shortcuts, it inserts unwanted shortcuts into the 'open with' menu, needlessly cluttering the interface. Instead of presenting two options, users are bombarded with five, making simple tasks unnecessarily complicated.

Writing the review a bit lately. The phone is awesome for the price. You get good battery with decent fast charger, beast processor, bright screen and great main camera. I have used the phone extensively and never noticed any performance issues. The main camera takes great pictures, especially, the portrait mode is stunning. Very few phones under 20K can take such beautiful portrait shots. Only thing I feel short is 3.5mm headphone jack. Although I got Vivo Type C earphones free with the phone but a 3.5mm jack is more functional.

Writing this review after 20 days usage. In my opinion1. if anyone need to buy light weight mobile I will recomend to buy.2. Best UI in recent time there is no lag when operating the mobile, opening an app like Hot star, Netflix app there is no lag and no delay on open a video.3. Camera best quality in camera amazing front  16MP and back 50MP one of the best get live location scenery.4. Battery Life - For only soft use without any Gaming guarantee upto 48 hrs charge life. Fast charging from 20% to 100% in just 45 to 50 mins.5. Feel less when playing Games, I am playing PUBG  games it took battery drainage slightly up. When playing 2 hrs 10 to 15% charge is going down.6. Heating Issue - There is no heating issue when playing games. played 2 hrs not feel any heating problem. Recommended this for all heavy users.(Note - it's my views, it's upto you how many hours you are using)7. Game Mode - Fantastic when On Ultra Game mode, you can control your battery life mode when playing games, as said above still battery might fell down as per my previous review.8. Music is best like Vivo up and down speakers provide best quality. Using Boult ear buds gives you a different feel when hearing music.9. Video - 1800x2400 video resolution gives best viewing experience when watching videos10. Over all Review -  One of best mobile satisfied with all performance till now. No external memory recommended to buy 256GB model.Internal memory 8G+8G extended gives smooth performance. 14 Android OS still good to go.

It's an all-rounder mobile. I like the cams, performance, design and also the built quality. It will definitely take place in top 5 mobiles under 25k and no one around 20k. It's worth buying it.

The iQOO Z9 5G is a solid option in the sub-Rs 20,000 category, offering robust performance, good camera capabilities, and decent battery life.Performance and Software:-The iQOO Z9 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 chipset, providing smooth performance for daily tasks and gaming. It scored highly on benchmarks, outperforming many competitors in its price range. The phone handles games like Call of Duty and Genshin Impact well without significant overheating. It runs on Android 14 with Funtouch OS 14, though it comes with a fair amount of pre-installed apps, which can be uninstalled.Camera:- The iQOO Z9 5G features a 50MP main camera with OIS, delivering impressive daylight shots with good dynamic range and color reproduction. The lack of an ultra-wide camera is a downside, but the 2MP depth sensor performs adequately for portrait shots. The 16MP front camera provides good selfies with accurate skin tones.Display:- The 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate offers vibrant colors and smooth navigation. However, legibility in bright sunlight could be better. The display adjusts refresh rates intelligently to save battery life.Battery Life:- The 5,000mAh battery provides solid endurance, lasting a full day with moderate to heavy usage. The phone supports 44W fast charging, reaching 50% in about 30 minutes and a full charge in just over an hour.Build and Design:- The phone has a plastic body with a glossy back and a solid build quality. It also features an IP54 rating for limited dust and water resistance, which is rare in this price segment.Cons:- The main drawbacks include the lack of a microSD card slot and the considerable amount of pre-installed apps. Additionally, iQOO only promises two years of software updates, which is less than some competitors.Overall, the iQOO Z9 5G is a well-rounded phone with excellent performance and a good camera, making it a strong contender in the budget 5G smartphone market.

I upgraded my phone to this after 3-4 years (Poco X3). So, this is the context upon which most of my review will be based off of.The price I paid and the items I received -1. Price: 20000 (Offer price) - 1000 (ICICI CC Offer) - 1600 (Realme 1 exch) - 1000 (bonus exch off) + 150 (Exch fee) - 300 (6% off on 5000rs amzn voucher purchase via HDFC Smart buy - Millennia CC) = 16,250 INR2. Items Recd: Phone (256GB) + FREE Wired Type-C Earphones (Vivo XE710)Review:The phone feels sturdy in hand, the polycarbonate frame and back are very good in quality. You have your handset with a pre-applied screen guard, transparent TPU case (doesn't fit tightly, there air gap between body and the case at the back so it feels loose), NO Type-C to 3.5mm adapter which is a downer, 44W adapter, Type A to Type C cable and Manuals. We get free wired earphones which are delivered separately, although I could've settled for a Type-C to Type-A adapter better. The earphones are decent - not too sturdy in build quality, flat audio output (lacking base), loudness, I felt, was a bit low too, good for calls.Coming to the phone:I feel the phone is snappy, haven't seen any lags in opening of the apps or anything. Yeah, while scrolling within the apps, there's a few stuttters here and there, but I think that's because of internet speed, causing the newer content to load slow.My major gripe with my unit (I dunno about others) is the VERY IFFY Fingerprint Sensor, it doesn't work at all sometimes for me, usually it does. But with a new phone it feels like a downer.I faced this problem only once, but if you've had it, then do restart your device to get back to narmalcy, when you switch your device to dark mode for the first time, the white text appears to be pink while scrolling. This happened only once and upon restart, got solved.In the battery and charging department I feel that the phone does a good job. I am able to use the phone for a day easily with around 35% remaining at EOD. The battery charges pretty quickly too. During my usage and charging, I didn't feel any heating issues. All this without the battery saver on.The speakers are good but should've been louder. I do feel that they are at good loudness at 200% but don't know if it's a good option to use, keeping in mind the device longevity.Cameras are all decent, no need to use the beautification as even without it, you get some beautification applied. Front and back both do their jobs well, no problems faced there. Images are sharp amd focusing is good.4G+ and 5G get detected quickly, calls are fine and the proximity sensor is good (never failed me). The wifi detection is good as well.Final Verdict:I am a guy who doesn't care about the post covid affect on the price, I check the absolute price and judge. So with that said, I feel that the phone is a really good deal, well balanced and definitely a good recommendation. The processor (DM7200) will ensure that the performance sustains for atleast 3 more years.

After 35 days review -- so the phone is good in this price range you can play any games in it and display is good also and about durability is plastic back so i say after just purchase you have to cover with lamination or any other protection for the body because scratch comes too fast in chrome and phone is comfortable according to size while gaming and the size is perfect, there is 2 times my phone got reboot while playing asphalt 9 but after talking customer care and tried their solution its never reboot and i didn't faced any problem, and about camera its not too high grade camera like 500000 priced phone but its above average so you can go fir this phone.

The Perfect midrange phone, comes with a lot of bugs
","
Brought this for 11.7k after exchanging Realme 9 SE+Bank offer.First impression after using for 1 day. I'll start with the problems as that's all you care about if you're thinking of buying this.Problems :1) The phone has a lot of bugs.Screen freezes randomlyNotifications bar, sometimes doesn't come down when you try to pull it down. Its Fixed after restarting. But in the last 6 hours , it happened 3 times.The Keyboard doesn't open sometimes .When you click to type something, the keyboard doesn't open.Its fixed if you lock and unlock the phone. But it's a problem regardless.Tried switching between Gboard and other keyboards. Still doesn't fix the issue.The phone comes with a pre setting , where long pressing the power button opens Google assistant instead of powering off. Its not an issue. You can change it in the settings.In my case , i had this problem along with the "" notification bar not working"" issue. Means I can't shut the phone down. The power off button is in the notifications bar.Initially I thought I had to wait till the power goes off, üòû.My phone froze and i couldn't even force it to shut down.Found online that i had to press the volume down and power button to force restart it.So change the Powerbutton to power off immediately.2) Overheating.Phone has mild Overheating issue.I am not a gamer.After setting up the phone, initially Overheating is expected for sometime.But even after 6 hours of just watching YouTube videos , the phone was a bit too warm to touch. Not too much. But I am sure gamers will complain about the heating.Maybe it will get optimised over night. I will update accordingly3) Icons are too big. Even in the smallest settings I feel it's too big.Its probably a personal problem, as I switched from Realme which gives complete customisation of icons.4) BloatwareI can understand the usual blaotwares like hot apps and hot games which come preloaded. But i didn't expect the Jovi home app (shortcut app for home screen) to be a permanent thing in the phone.The icon for that is permanently fixed on the notification bar. Its placement is where usually settings icon should be and it's annoying.Can't remove it , nor disable the app internally.Most of these problems might get fixed in the first update. Let's see.Pros1)The UI is extremely smooth.The animations are perfect. Smooth as butter.If you want the phone to feel even more snappy, turn off all  animations and it feels as fast as lightning.The fingerprint senser and unlocking is extremely smooth and snappy.2) Screen is great. The colors and brightness makes a great viewing experience.3)The battery lasts a day, Just as advertised. Almost 6 hours of YouTube, an hour of Browsing, 3 hours of Social media, and some 3 hours of Streaming and the battery was 17 percent left  down from a 100.(Power saving mode was on (after 30 percent). refresh rate set to 60).12 hours of moderate use. Enough to last a day. Didn't try gaming yet tho.0 to 100 , Charging takes around 45 minutes.#Overheating during charging is there. But that's common in all fast charging phonesOverall, great choice if you can wait for the software updates to fix the issues.I don't think there is a better choice for budget gamers other than this (below 20000).

A good value for money product and I just have few problems. I have been using this for more than 2 months.The sound of speaker isn't too high even though there is an audio booster mode. Some parts of the camera department were pretty average. And they should have provided a charger which charges even faster. There are other brands providing faster charger in this price segment. Overall, it's a completely worth product.

Pros:-CameraPerformanceRam managementCons:-1. UI/OS(there are some issues with OS, I hope that iqoo will fix these issue with a minor update soon).2. Body(everything part of the body is good but between the power button and volume Rocker, if you press a little bit then you can feel that it's weak and also it makes some sound. Same is with the charging point, I don't know that whether it's my unit or every iqoo z9 whenever I plug the charger to this phone, it makes the same noise as the volume Rocker part but here is more loud noise)Conclusion:-1. I'll recommend this phone bcoz there's no issue in gaming and normal usage.2. COD mobile runs at 90fps and bgmi at 60fps.3. charging is fast enough and battery backup is also good (8-10hrs with normal usage at 120hz and little bit gaming)4. The issues are not a big deal as you can ignore them easily and to be very honest I don't care about the issues I encountered.5. Consider the 2nd ConAnd this really really importantYou must know about this seller, on India Mart website, the seller's rating is 1.8 and everyone their stated that this seller sends defective products through Amazon. So, before buying any phone or expensive thing please check the seller background.

The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G offers an attractive package, especially for users seeking solid performance at a budget-friendly price. Here‚Äôs a closer look at its key aspects:Design and Display:The Aqua Flow variant looks sleek with its gradient finish, adding a touch of elegance. The phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy for one-handed use. Its 6.58-inch Full HD+ display is sharp and vibrant, offering good color reproduction and brightness for media consumption. Though not AMOLED, the display performs well in outdoor lighting conditions and provides smooth scrolling with a 120Hz refresh rate.Performance:Powered by the Dimensity 6300 5G chipset, this device ensures a snappy and fluid user experience. It handles multitasking well, although the 4GB RAM might struggle slightly with heavier apps and games when compared to 6GB or 8GB variants. For regular usage like social media, video streaming, and casual gaming, the phone performs admirably. The inclusion of 5G support is a strong future-proofing move, especially at this price point.Camera:The 50MP Sony AI Camera setup is one of the phone‚Äôs strongest features. It takes good-quality pictures in daylight with sharp details and vivid colors. However, low-light performance could be better, as images tend to get noisy in dim environments. The AI optimizations, such as scene recognition, enhance the photography experience, making it easy to capture decent shots with minimal effort. The front camera is decent for selfies and video calls, though not exceptional.Battery and Charging:The phone packs a 5000mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day of moderate use. The charger in the box is a nice touch, offering fast charging support that gets the phone charged in under two hours. Battery optimization is good, ensuring you won‚Äôt run out of juice during regular day-to-day tasks.Storage and Software:With 128GB of storage, there‚Äôs ample room for apps, media, and files, and the phone supports microSD expansion if needed. The software experience is clean and customizable with iQOO‚Äôs Funtouch OS, which runs smoothly on Android. The UI is user-friendly, though there are some pre-installed apps that may not be necessary, but they can be uninstalled.Verdict:The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G is a competitive mid-range smartphone with solid performance, 5G support, a reliable camera, and good battery life. If you‚Äôre looking for a budget-friendly 5G phone with a stylish design, it‚Äôs a solid pick, but the 4

I am reviewing this after fully used and drop, ip test with pros and cons. If you want a phone with great performance, decent Camara also with latest Android 14 under 12k this phone will be perfect..Best things are it's comes with Android 14 with funtouch os (if you are previously Vivo user you will got this) which is a great experience for me as 1st time user.On these segment its comes with 50 mp Sony IMX sensor üòò with popular modes like slomo, which is really appreciated for budget lovers..It's also supported 2k resolution with no lag..ü§©You will get 6gb ram with auto booster and 128 gb variant under 12k, it's a massive storage on budget..ü§óIp64 with dust resistant, I have compared with other phones on this budget they have ip54 with no dust resistant feature..üòÑThis are the main points that I liked much, also I liked the wifi 5, fingerprint it's really fast with no animation, less bloat apps, ultra game mode etc..üòâLet's see the cons that I've got..üòëü•¥Charging watt should be better at least 20 watts with inbox charger, 10 watt charger comes with it but the phone is supported 25 watt fast charging.. but 5000mah is good for long lasting uses.. charging time 5-80% was 1.15 hrs with inbox charger.Display should be comes with at least type IPS, it's comes with LCD display and decent colour gamut and 90hz gives most of all other phones on these budget. 1080p display will be much appreciated..Design is good but if you have seen the poco c61 design that is comes with new radial cam design, so it's a disappointed because that's a under 7k phone..üòÜAnimation uses cause phone slower than usual..bso I will suggest not to use that..Overall seen, decent Camera and Design, great performance (I will suggest to buy 6gb variant) with 5g variant, full day battery backup (for less gamers), IP64 with dust resistant üòç, latest Android 14 with 2 years of major upgrades and 3 years of security updates, handy weight with silicon cover on box.. Overall good on these budget segment with trust of VIVO.. ü´∂

Value for money
","
I bought the Mocha brown color and believe me, everyone else had trouble believing that it's a budget phone!My delivery experience with exchange:As usual, whenever I want to EXCHANGE a mobile, I have to rely on Amazon instead of FLIP(FRAUD)KART!I think nobody should exchange mobile with Fraudkart because their exchange system is crooked. They have given the responsibility of valuing the old mobile to their delivery boy. Now the delivery boys have become king and always find out unnecessarily small,  artificial defects in the mobile so that your valuation is decreased by 50%, then they will ask for BRIBE openly like Rs.500 or 1000 to assign the higher valuation! I have seen it happen with dozens of my friends and colleagues who were too naive to fall for Fraudkart's schemes.Hence, I always give old mobiles to Amazon in exchange for new ones, AMAZON DELIVERY GUYS NEVER TRIED TO DEFRAUD ME IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. I behave like a responsible customer and declare the genuine condition of the Mobile beforehand such as scratches on screen, body cracks etc. and the delivery guys accept it without any arguments. KUDOS TO AMAZON for such a transparent process!About the Mobile:I have a OnePlus 11 but was too tensed about it especially while getting millions of calls and messages everyday so I decided to buy a secondary mobile which could be abused without any guilt. BTW I just realised that I always had a mobile with AMOLED screen right since the early days when I bought the Galaxy S2 when it was launched! I never ever bought one with a LCD screen ever and this Iqoo Z9 Lite is the first one and I don't hate it as much as I hoped I would.Display quality is far better than cheap LCD mobiles and 90 Hz frequency is an icing on the cake. Since it's a 720p resolution, I can see the pixelated texts if I look closely but that's an exception, normally I don't mind the lower resolution in day to day life. I wish the max brightness was higher but hey, it's a budget mobile so you can't get everything in it!Do note that this mobile HAS ONLY 1 SINGLE MICROPHONE at the bottom, no additional mics for noise cancellation at our end. I am pretty sure I will hear complaints from the call receiver when I am in a crowded place with lots of background noise.The OS is pretty smooth and fast but quite laggy in comparison to a OnePlus Nord or Redmi HyperOS.Conclusion: I could not find a better deal for my requirements so I bought this mobile but others should definitely explore other options if they are going to buy it as their one & only mobile.

Decent mobile phone with good features, the UI could be more responsive but does the job. The battery looks decent for regular use. The display is very basic, could have provided amoled one, the clarity is not that great. The Dual sim is not so clear how it works, there is a single slot for second sim + SD card, so not sure how it would work. If you are looking for less than 10K mobile with decent features then go for it if you are ok with basic display clarity.

","
The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G offers an attractive package, especially for users seeking solid performance at a budget-friendly price. Here‚Äôs a closer look at its key aspects:Design and Display:The Aqua Flow variant looks sleek with its gradient finish, adding a touch of elegance. The phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy for one-handed use. Its 6.58-inch Full HD+ display is sharp and vibrant, offering good color reproduction and brightness for media consumption. Though not AMOLED, the display performs well in outdoor lighting conditions and provides smooth scrolling with a 120Hz refresh rate.Performance:Powered by the Dimensity 6300 5G chipset, this device ensures a snappy and fluid user experience. It handles multitasking well, although the 4GB RAM might struggle slightly with heavier apps and games when compared to 6GB or 8GB variants. For regular usage like social media, video streaming, and casual gaming, the phone performs admirably. The inclusion of 5G support is a strong future-proofing move, especially at this price point.Camera:The 50MP Sony AI Camera setup is one of the phone‚Äôs strongest features. It takes good-quality pictures in daylight with sharp details and vivid colors. However, low-light performance could be better, as images tend to get noisy in dim environments. The AI optimizations, such as scene recognition, enhance the photography experience, making it easy to capture decent shots with minimal effort. The front camera is decent for selfies and video calls, though not exceptional.Battery and Charging:The phone packs a 5000mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day of moderate use. The charger in the box is a nice touch, offering fast charging support that gets the phone charged in under two hours. Battery optimization is good, ensuring you won‚Äôt run out of juice during regular day-to-day tasks.Storage and Software:With 128GB of storage, there‚Äôs ample room for apps, media, and files, and the phone supports microSD expansion if needed. The software experience is clean and customizable with iQOO‚Äôs Funtouch OS, which runs smoothly on Android. The UI is user-friendly, though there are some pre-installed apps that may not be necessary, but they can be uninstalled.Verdict:The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G is a competitive mid-range smartphone with solid performance, 5G support, a reliable camera, and good battery life. If you‚Äôre looking for a budget-friendly 5G phone with a stylish design, it‚Äôs a solid pick, but the 4

Budget friendly great performance, 90hz smoothness, phone under 12k(6gb) with decent Camera
","
I am reviewing this after fully used and drop, ip test with pros and cons. If you want a phone with great performance, decent Camara also with latest Android 14 under 12k this phone will be perfect..Best things are it's comes with Android 14 with funtouch os (if you are previously Vivo user you will got this) which is a great experience for me as 1st time user.On these segment its comes with 50 mp Sony IMX sensor üòò with popular modes like slomo, which is really appreciated for budget lovers..It's also supported 2k resolution with no lag..ü§©You will get 6gb ram with auto booster and 128 gb variant under 12k, it's a massive storage on budget..ü§óIp64 with dust resistant, I have compared with other phones on this budget they have ip54 with no dust resistant feature..üòÑThis are the main points that I liked much, also I liked the wifi 5, fingerprint it's really fast with no animation, less bloat apps, ultra game mode etc..üòâLet's see the cons that I've got..üòëü•¥Charging watt should be better at least 20 watts with inbox charger, 10 watt charger comes with it but the phone is supported 25 watt fast charging.. but 5000mah is good for long lasting uses.. charging time 5-80% was 1.15 hrs with inbox charger.Display should be comes with at least type IPS, it's comes with LCD display and decent colour gamut and 90hz gives most of all other phones on these budget. 1080p display will be much appreciated..Design is good but if you have seen the poco c61 design that is comes with new radial cam design, so it's a disappointed because that's a under 7k phone..üòÜAnimation uses cause phone slower than usual..bso I will suggest not to use that..Overall seen, decent Camera and Design, great performance (I will suggest to buy 6gb variant) with 5g variant, full day battery backup (for less gamers), IP64 with dust resistant üòç, latest Android 14 with 2 years of major upgrades and 3 years of security updates, handy weight with silicon cover on box.. Overall good on these budget segment with trust of VIVO.. ü´∂

Value for money
","
I bought the Mocha brown color and believe me, everyone else had trouble believing that it's a budget phone!My delivery experience with exchange:As usual, whenever I want to EXCHANGE a mobile, I have to rely on Amazon instead of FLIP(FRAUD)KART!I think nobody should exchange mobile with Fraudkart because their exchange system is crooked. They have given the responsibility of valuing the old mobile to their delivery boy. Now the delivery boys have become king and always find out unnecessarily small,  artificial defects in the mobile so that your valuation is decreased by 50%, then they will ask for BRIBE openly like Rs.500 or 1000 to assign the higher valuation! I have seen it happen with dozens of my friends and colleagues who were too naive to fall for Fraudkart's schemes.Hence, I always give old mobiles to Amazon in exchange for new ones, AMAZON DELIVERY GUYS NEVER TRIED TO DEFRAUD ME IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. I behave like a responsible customer and declare the genuine condition of the Mobile beforehand such as scratches on screen, body cracks etc. and the delivery guys accept it without any arguments. KUDOS TO AMAZON for such a transparent process!About the Mobile:I have a OnePlus 11 but was too tensed about it especially while getting millions of calls and messages everyday so I decided to buy a secondary mobile which could be abused without any guilt. BTW I just realised that I always had a mobile with AMOLED screen right since the early days when I bought the Galaxy S2 when it was launched! I never ever bought one with a LCD screen ever and this Iqoo Z9 Lite is the first one and I don't hate it as much as I hoped I would.Display quality is far better than cheap LCD mobiles and 90 Hz frequency is an icing on the cake. Since it's a 720p resolution, I can see the pixelated texts if I look closely but that's an exception, normally I don't mind the lower resolution in day to day life. I wish the max brightness was higher but hey, it's a budget mobile so you can't get everything in it!Do note that this mobile HAS ONLY 1 SINGLE MICROPHONE at the bottom, no additional mics for noise cancellation at our end. I am pretty sure I will hear complaints from the call receiver when I am in a crowded place with lots of background noise.The OS is pretty smooth and fast but quite laggy in comparison to a OnePlus Nord or Redmi HyperOS.Conclusion: I could not find a better deal for my requirements so I bought this mobile but others should definitely explore other options if they are going to buy it as their one & only mobile.

The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G offers an attractive package, especially for users seeking solid performance at a budget-friendly price. Here‚Äôs a closer look at its key aspects:Design and Display:The Aqua Flow variant looks sleek with its gradient finish, adding a touch of elegance. The phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy for one-handed use. Its 6.58-inch Full HD+ display is sharp and vibrant, offering good color reproduction and brightness for media consumption. Though not AMOLED, the display performs well in outdoor lighting conditions and provides smooth scrolling with a 120Hz refresh rate.Performance:Powered by the Dimensity 6300 5G chipset, this device ensures a snappy and fluid user experience. It handles multitasking well, although the 4GB RAM might struggle slightly with heavier apps and games when compared to 6GB or 8GB variants. For regular usage like social media, video streaming, and casual gaming, the phone performs admirably. The inclusion of 5G support is a strong future-proofing move, especially at this price point.Camera:The 50MP Sony AI Camera setup is one of the phone‚Äôs strongest features. It takes good-quality pictures in daylight with sharp details and vivid colors. However, low-light performance could be better, as images tend to get noisy in dim environments. The AI optimizations, such as scene recognition, enhance the photography experience, making it easy to capture decent shots with minimal effort. The front camera is decent for selfies and video calls, though not exceptional.Battery and Charging:The phone packs a 5000mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day of moderate use. The charger in the box is a nice touch, offering fast charging support that gets the phone charged in under two hours. Battery optimization is good, ensuring you won‚Äôt run out of juice during regular day-to-day tasks.Storage and Software:With 128GB of storage, there‚Äôs ample room for apps, media, and files, and the phone supports microSD expansion if needed. The software experience is clean and customizable with iQOO‚Äôs Funtouch OS, which runs smoothly on Android. The UI is user-friendly, though there are some pre-installed apps that may not be necessary, but they can be uninstalled.Verdict:The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G is a competitive mid-range smartphone with solid performance, 5G support, a reliable camera, and good battery life. If you‚Äôre looking for a budget-friendly 5G phone with a stylish design, it‚Äôs a solid pick, but the 4

Budget friendly great performance, 90hz smoothness, phone under 12k(6gb) with decent Camera
","
I am reviewing this after fully used and drop, ip test with pros and cons. If you want a phone with great performance, decent Camara also with latest Android 14 under 12k this phone will be perfect..Best things are it's comes with Android 14 with funtouch os (if you are previously Vivo user you will got this) which is a great experience for me as 1st time user.On these segment its comes with 50 mp Sony IMX sensor üòò with popular modes like slomo, which is really appreciated for budget lovers..It's also supported 2k resolution with no lag..ü§©You will get 6gb ram with auto booster and 128 gb variant under 12k, it's a massive storage on budget..ü§óIp64 with dust resistant, I have compared with other phones on this budget they have ip54 with no dust resistant feature..üòÑThis are the main points that I liked much, also I liked the wifi 5, fingerprint it's really fast with no animation, less bloat apps, ultra game mode etc..üòâLet's see the cons that I've got..üòëü•¥Charging watt should be better at least 20 watts with inbox charger, 10 watt charger comes with it but the phone is supported 25 watt fast charging.. but 5000mah is good for long lasting uses.. charging time 5-80% was 1.15 hrs with inbox charger.Display should be comes with at least type IPS, it's comes with LCD display and decent colour gamut and 90hz gives most of all other phones on these budget. 1080p display will be much appreciated..Design is good but if you have seen the poco c61 design that is comes with new radial cam design, so it's a disappointed because that's a under 7k phone..üòÜAnimation uses cause phone slower than usual..bso I will suggest not to use that..Overall seen, decent Camera and Design, great performance (I will suggest to buy 6gb variant) with 5g variant, full day battery backup (for less gamers), IP64 with dust resistant üòç, latest Android 14 with 2 years of major upgrades and 3 years of security updates, handy weight with silicon cover on box.. Overall good on these budget segment with trust of VIVO.. ü´∂

I bought the Mocha brown color and believe me, everyone else had trouble believing that it's a budget phone!My delivery experience with exchange:As usual, whenever I want to EXCHANGE a mobile, I have to rely on Amazon instead of FLIP(FRAUD)KART!I think nobody should exchange mobile with Fraudkart because their exchange system is crooked. They have given the responsibility of valuing the old mobile to their delivery boy. Now the delivery boys have become king and always find out unnecessarily small,  artificial defects in the mobile so that your valuation is decreased by 50%, then they will ask for BRIBE openly like Rs.500 or 1000 to assign the higher valuation! I have seen it happen with dozens of my friends and colleagues who were too naive to fall for Fraudkart's schemes.Hence, I always give old mobiles to Amazon in exchange for new ones, AMAZON DELIVERY GUYS NEVER TRIED TO DEFRAUD ME IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. I behave like a responsible customer and declare the genuine condition of the Mobile beforehand such as scratches on screen, body cracks etc. and the delivery guys accept it without any arguments. KUDOS TO AMAZON for such a transparent process!About the Mobile:I have a OnePlus 11 but was too tensed about it especially while getting millions of calls and messages everyday so I decided to buy a secondary mobile which could be abused without any guilt. BTW I just realised that I always had a mobile with AMOLED screen right since the early days when I bought the Galaxy S2 when it was launched! I never ever bought one with a LCD screen ever and this Iqoo Z9 Lite is the first one and I don't hate it as much as I hoped I would.Display quality is far better than cheap LCD mobiles and 90 Hz frequency is an icing on the cake. Since it's a 720p resolution, I can see the pixelated texts if I look closely but that's an exception, normally I don't mind the lower resolution in day to day life. I wish the max brightness was higher but hey, it's a budget mobile so you can't get everything in it!Do note that this mobile HAS ONLY 1 SINGLE MICROPHONE at the bottom, no additional mics for noise cancellation at our end. I am pretty sure I will hear complaints from the call receiver when I am in a crowded place with lots of background noise.The OS is pretty smooth and fast but quite laggy in comparison to a OnePlus Nord or Redmi HyperOS.Conclusion: I could not find a better deal for my requirements so I bought this mobile but others should definitely explore other options if they are going to buy it as their one & only mobile.

It's pros are :-It is good in performance , battery and network/internet(because of 5g) and also storageIt's cons are :-This phone clicks clear but faded colored photos in comparison to phones i have in same price range ""OPPO A12""(10000 Rs. , 5 years old phone) and ""REDMI NOTE 10S""(12000 Rs., 3 or 4 years old phone)And it's display is also normal(nothing like oled or amoled) and shows faded colours. It doesn't have dual speakersConclusion:-Please consider ""redmi note 10s"" In place of this it's completely value for money it has every this but just you have to compromise in storage which is half of this and it is 4g phone but literally trut me there is not a huge difference in connectivity. and it doesn't have charging and also cable quality was cheapI REALLY REGRET BUYING THIS PHONE üò£üòûüòîüòñ I TRIED TO RETURN THIS PHONE BUT I CAN'Tüòî BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FALUT IN THE UNIT

Product Review: iQOO Z9x 5G (Tornado Green, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)I recently upgraded to the iQOO Z9x 5G, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations! Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my experience:Performance:Equipped with the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 processor and 6GB of RAM, this phone delivers smooth performance across the board. Whether I‚Äôm gaming, multitasking, or streaming videos, everything runs seamlessly without lag. The Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 handles demanding apps with ease, making it a reliable choice for heavy users.Display:The display is stunning! The vibrant colors and sharp resolution make everything look amazing, from photos to videos. The 6.67-inch screen size is perfect for viewing content, and I appreciate the immersive experience it offers, especially for gaming and watching movies.Camera:The camera performance is impressive, especially for the price point. The photos come out sharp and vibrant, even in low light conditions. I‚Äôve been enjoying capturing moments with the various shooting modes available, which add a creative touch to my photography.Design:The Tornado Green color is sleek and eye-catching. The design feels premium, and the matte finish not only looks great but also minimizes fingerprints. It‚Äôs comfortable to hold and fits nicely in my hand, making it easy to use.Battery Life:The battery life is solid, easily lasting me through a full day of heavy use. The fast charging feature is a major plus, allowing me to quickly top up when I‚Äôm in a hurry.Storage:With 128GB of storage, I have plenty of space for apps, photos, and videos. The option to expand storage further with a microSD card is a nice bonus.Overall Impression:The iQOO Z9x 5G is a fantastic smartphone that combines performance, style, and value. It‚Äôs perfect for anyone looking for a reliable device without breaking the bank. I highly recommend it!Rating: 5/5 Stars

Gets the job done
","
First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.

IQOO Z9x 5G MOBILE - A PERFECT ALTERNATE FOR APPLE I PHONE...
","
This mobile is a beast at affordable price point. Design, built quality, features, performance is amazing. For any day to day usage products like electronic gadgets, vehicles, etc.. first comes built quality & longevity. Genuine & practical experience from my near & dear is IQ00 Mobile earlier versions like IQOO 7, IQOO 7 PRO, etc.. using for last three to four years are absolutely performing well with brand new piece as of now. No service/repair issues till date. I used Apple I phone right from I phone 4 to I phone 15 (except 13). It's best part being built quality with long lasting usage without any hiccups. Rest features, performance, etc.. now a days almost every mobile has.. Purchasing I phone every time with upgrade is nothing but throwing the money in Apple's dustbin...! In a nutshell... IQOO mobile is the best alternate/replacement for Apple I phone with affordable price point.Cheers...

","




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



The iQOO Z9s 5G is a great mid-range phone, featuring a sleek design and a 6.58-inch 120Hz AMOLED display for smooth visuals. Powered by the Snapdragon 778G processor, it delivers solid performance for multitasking and gaming, with 5G connectivity ensuring fast speeds. The 64MP triple-camera system captures good shots in daylight, though low-light performance could be better. Its 4500mAh battery with fast charging keeps you going throughout the day. Overall, the Z9s 5G is an excellent value for its price, offering a strong display, performance, and 5G support.

Worst service from Amazon
","
I had experienced the worst service from Amazon. I bought this product in exchange and although my mobile was in very good condition the exchange boy then also charged 500 rupees and said your mobile colour is not good, this rhe reason he gave. Amazon exchange service is just a loot don't buy anything in exchange Amazon is just fooling by claiming the price on exchange and asking money afterwards without any defect in your mobile.Mobile I bought Iqoo z9x is very good and working very fast and battery lasts for approx 2 days with normal tasks and camera is also good for me, overall it is very good in this budget.

I'm satisfied at the same time unsatisfied with stereo
","
I was in search of a phone having neat basic requirements. My conditions are battery life ,camera and storage. Other features are complementary for me. I think that average phone user need only these functions. Afterall I'm not a gamer.I came to it's a gaming phn .Any way I tried searching new  devices. Iniitially my budget range was 30k but unfortunately I couldn't rely on this.During this period of time I came to know about IQOO and googled the details . I came to know it's the subbrand of Vivo. I was happy.I searched Amazon and fixed IQOO z9x which is budget frndly and having nice basic features.I was impressed with 6k mah battery backup.I chose dark colour . Storage is only 128gb and the camera is fine not too good. Within this prize range, we cannot expect more.I'm satisfied with product. Waiting for Indian release of IQOO 13 on dec 5.After all,  I want to point out some cons of this device.The speakers of this device is compromised.Receiver of our call can hear our voice beautifuly. No issues. But I feel it's not up to mark for us. There is a limitation and unsatisfaction during calling especially in a town area or a crowd even in full volume.Next is actual speaker of this device. It needs improvement because the sound played during YouTube or any other video player is unsatisfactory. When compared to my previous redmi device I feel it's not upto mark.My main unsatisfactory points are related to this device stereo. Others are ok.

Overall everything is good as per price. I have deducted one star because I feel this phone is bit heavier than Oppo or Vivo in this range. That may be because of its 6000mah battery. This phone is not that slimmest as they promised. The safety glaas they applyed slightly comes over the punch hole selfie camera. Rest everything is fine. More colour variations should be available for z9x because this phone is best one under 12k. üëçüèª

I got a phone with air bubbles in the screen protector which is so irritating. The backside of the phone looks nice and I'll use for some days and update on how it works.Edit: adding a star cause the phone is amazing and it provides a really good software experience.Also the back camera is just amazing. Front one is okay but not rly a big issue. Gaming is smooth too.Overall it's a good phone you won't regret buying it!

Really happy to buy this phone 5g coverage and calling is too good, display also up to the mark, battery back up too good, Full charge in 100mins, camera also okay,but if they give second mic means it's so helpful in calling then other persons are not hear sarounding sounds it's major diffect and Vivo I liked notification light at top of the screen but in new editions they removed it's foolish thought. Lite slow when u clear all minimised apps when u clear it's closing little bit slow.Vibration is not that much good.Without second mic is very bad. In call other person facing other sounds.Overall to the price it's a good phonePaisa vasool.

Bilkul sahi or jo sach hai vese review dunga guys.Pros(shi kya hai )1 camera quality  bhot mast hai ek number ka hai night mode bhi gajab hai .2 Display ki Brightness bhi bhot sahi hai kafi bright hai or smoothness bhot badhiya hai .3. Gaming ke liye bhot badhiya fon hai bgmi 40 fps pe smooth ultra pe or ff ultra pe makhna chalegi .4. Ip rating bhot badhiya hai gille hatho se bhi phone chal padta hai me water park me leke gya tha ise or 2 meter tak 4 se 5 mint tak kuch bhi nhi hoga.Cons (galat kya hai )1.battery bhai sahi batau na agr tum 5g use karte ho to battery 4500 mah jesa kam kregi ok but agr tum 4g use krte ho to 5600 mah jesa kam kregi matlab 5g me 7 se 8 ghante full charge or 4g me 11 se 13 ghante full charge pe2. Heating bhot jyada hai agr tumhare environment ka temperature 32 degree se kam hai to phone heat nhi krega . Or agr temperature 32 degree se uupar hi to phone or adapter bhot garam ho jayenge3 .battery charging normal temperature 32 pe 1 mint me 1 percent charge hogi .

Nothing too exciting about the phone but yeah my old one was broken and happy to use the new phone. Camera is definitely good. Performance is perfect as of now. Some scrolling issues with the screen as it is uneven at times. Also when sharing images to Instagram or any other app after clicking it just gives a white screen and you have to click somewhere on the screen again to get to the page but still it does not share it. You have to go inside the app and then choose the picture from the gallery to upload it. One of the apps is also unresponsive and had to delete it, though I never installed it again so not sure what was the issue.

","
12 gb ram minimum is kind of necessary, few times Agni 2 hangs due to that as I use many applications in background. Especially relevant as this is the top end offering from lava. Bit disappointed as a lava fan, rest of specs looks great. Ordering as usual. Wish to see lava competing with vivo next time on higher end/premium segment offerings. Like v40 pro 5g with competitive pricing. Go aggressive as many premium users prefers no bloatware os-es who cannot afford pixels. Highlight is pure Android experience as always and made in India badging. #proudlyIndianAfter use review: Received it yesterday evening and it looks stunning. Rear display features are excellent and eye catching. Looks like a premium phone with glass back. May new OS features as well in camera side in addition to Agni 2 features. Great way to start with. Rerating to 5 stars even without 12 gb ram. :)

Only one word awesome
","
I wanted to buy a budget 5g phone for my wife having  following criteria:-1. Superb design2. Good Ram and ROM3. Good camera if not Superb4. Good screen if not best5. No bloatware and stock android6. And finally, Good battery with day day performance as my wife don't play game.I am truly happy to share that this phone has exceeded my expectations in every corner. Actually, I was little skeptical about the screen as it is only HD plus, however to my surprise, it is best HD plus display I have every seen. Not much difference. Camera also exceeded my expectations, though little improvement is required in white exposure. And surprisingly,  it is from indian brand Lava. Long live Lava!! Keep doing great. I am owing samsung but I swear If Lava keeps doing this, my next phone will be from Lava. Everyone in my family and friends praised this. My true words.Few things which was a true surprise as I didn't expect at all in this price segment:-1. Haptics (best means best, even better than premium segment phones)2. Screen color reproduction is sometimes equal to that of Amoled, though not always. But believe me HD plus display will not be a regret.3. awesome Ram management and UFC 2.1 will definitely make your feel of using a premium phones4. Looks - not even 25 to 30k phone will come near to this.Though, some cons are also there-1. Slow charger - takes around 3 hours to charge battery, though battery backup is Superb.2. Video lags in 2k 60 FPS, though work fine in 1080 60 fps. This really requires efforts from Lava as it is possible to improve via update.3. Camera white exposure and portrait mode requires improvements.4. Background stream - in review videos, option of background stream like YouTube is shown, however in reality, I am unable to see this. Please get this done with an update.5. Last but not least - place of fingerprint sensor or power key sometimes feel uncomfortable for new user. Though, not an issue after some days use.If the above issues are possible to resolve, please resolve Lava.No phone can come close to this pure stock android experience in this price range.However, the way you have made a come back in indian market is Superb. All the best my indian company. Keep doing great.

Got 8gb 128gb variant.PROS: decent camera, average performance, did not try any games, never lags or heats up in daily tasks. Internet speed and 5G reception is very good. Battery lasts 1-1/2 days. Full charge in 3 - 4 hours from 5% charge left. Glass back looks good. Camera module design attracts people. Fingerprint and face unlock is superfast even in low light.CONS: shape of the phone is sharp. Not very comfortable to hold. Display is non OLED one, hurts eyes on long video watching. Single speaker, no stereo.OPINION:Not good for Content consumption or gaming. Highly recommended as daily use phone.

5G speeds in my area are varying from 550mbps to 1+gbps on some nights. The phone works like a breeze. Bought it on sale on Oct 1st, 2023. Tested thoroughly ever since. And no lag. I am playing COD on HD settings. Battery is easily a Day's worth. Heating is minimal if not nothing worth noticing. And stock Android is amazing. Cam quality is yuck (I mean you can make do with it but the file size of each pic is over 15mb and whenever I had to upload some pic to someone I had to first send it to myself from WhatsApp so it doesn't cross the upload limit which is a hassle but overall camera is okayish for the price point) but camera is not what I bought it for. The audio quality is good and auto call recording feature works neatly unlike some apps in Play Store that record only one side. The recordings were crystal clear of both parties when I recorded. Very useful if you need audio proofs in any issue and it does not let other side know that you are recording them which is apt. I have upgraded my Android to 13 and all features are smooth, the dimensity processor is quite good. I was fiddling with buying this phone or Nokia G42 5G that launched at the same time but chose this to support an Indian brand and boy have I been correct. My friend was going through similar thoughts and I suggested him this but he wasn't trusting of Lava and bought Nokia G42 5G, it is not a bad phone but it is not this goooooood!! Dimensity 700 has managed to whoop Snapdragon 480, by a margin. Just go through the Antutu and geekbench charts of both phones also try Cpu-Z to monitor internals and you'll know what I am talking about! This Lava Mobile is total PAISA VASOOL! üòÅüòÑü´∂üíØ‚ô•Ô∏è

","
The Lava Blaze 5G is an affordable 5G smartphone with notable features for its price range. Here are its pros and cons:Pros5G Connectivity:One of the most affordable 5G smartphones, allowing access to faster internet speeds and improved network performance.Memory and Storage:Equipped with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS 2.2 storage, it offers smooth multitasking and faster data transfer speeds, with ample storage for apps and media.Design:The Glass Green variant has a stylish and premium look, providing an appealing aesthetic.Battery Life:Typically features a large battery (around 5000mAh), providing good battery life that lasts through a day of heavy use.Display:Often comes with a decent display for its price range, offering a good viewing experience for media consumption and everyday use.Price:Offers good value for money, especially considering its 5G capabilities and hardware specifications.Cons:Processor: The chipset might be lower-end (likely a MediaTek Dimensity series), which, while sufficient for everyday tasks, might not perform as well with intensive applications or gaming compared to higher-end models.Camera Quality:The camera setup, while adequate for basic photography, may not offer the same quality and versatility as more expensive smartphones, particularly in low-light conditions.Software Experience:The user interface may include bloatware and might not be as refined or feature-rich as more premium brands. Software updates might also be less frequent.Build Quality:While the design is attractive, the actual build materials may be less durable compared to higher-end devices that use metal or higher-grade materials.No Wireless Charging:Like many budget devices, it lacks wireless charging support, which might be a drawback for some users.Display Quality:The display, while decent, may not offer the high resolution, refresh rate, or brightness found in more premium devices, affecting the overall media consumption experience.The Lava Blaze 5G is an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers seeking 5G connectivity and decent performance. However, it does come with trade-offs in processing power, camera quality, and build materials.

Good value for money, but has few flaws
","
I ordered this phone on Saturday 11th November and got it within 24 hours, so Amazon's delivery deserves 5 stars.Coming to the positives of the product -The phone is a good value for money.  Getting a 5g phone under Rs. 10000/- is a deal.  The battery life is also amazing, getting me 1.5 days on my usage pattern.  Clean android, I like it, else on my previous phones I would spend a lot of time removing bloatware.  Excellent display clarity, vibrant colours on display. Being clean android, boot time is faster, setup is faster, even factory reset gets over quickly.Very good response time, apps open fast, smooth multi-tasking, and I am not a gamer. Speaker for music playback is loud and clear.The issues with the phone -Software glitch on display.  When I delete a widget, the widget is still seen in the home screen.  if I delete an app, the app icon is still seen on the home screen or app drawer.  If you scroll the app drawer, the deleted app icon follows you.  You need to turn off the screen or start and close another app to sort this issue out.Call volume is not loud, compared to music playback volume.  In noisy places there will be a difficulty in hearing the person on the other end.Camera is not that great, at times pictures will look nice in the gallery, but when you transfer it to a computer you will see grains, over exposure.The vibrator is not very strong and not very audible. At times I am not able to hear it even if the phone is kept on a table.  You can't feel it in your pocket.There is an option, Vibrate on call connect.  When you call someone and when they answer the call the phone is supposed to vibrate.  This feature worked on my old phone, but in this phone, even after this option enabled it does not work.  Another issue is when you use any app that requires the internet connectivity (mobile data) such as the browser or the playstore, the app cannot access the internet for atleast 3-4 seconds.  After you search for some information in the browser or you type a website address, you need to wait for 3 seconds for the browsing to start.  When you open the  playstore, you need to wait for 3-4 seconds for it to show all the apps and even then the loading is incomplete, as you scroll down you will see the page loading slowly.The support from the manufacturer - LAVA on these issues is bad, it has been more than 7 days, after giving them my phone for extracting my log files to check the error and everytime I call the service manager he keeps asking for more time and more time.  Please be aware selling a product is not as important as servicing it or supporting it.  Not a good experience with LAVA.

After using it for sometimes i think it's a good configured smartphone.Camera is good if you're are coming from low end hardware to this phone it's worth it. although low light photo will be little hazy but it tolerable if you really want to take good picture use pro mode customize your own setting.(or use modded gcam)Battery life after heavy usage on 2gb per day data it's gives more than 8 hours runtime.All application run smoothly except some custom app like redmi weather app(didn't work). network is really good in it everything run smoothly but i don't like the launcher it's nice light weight but it's missing options like not allowing play store from creating desktop/homescreen icon, miss those little light indicator on old smartphone, missing option to change font(pure hatred for default google font) .display is nice but dont like jelly feeling when i am scrolling.charger is normal charger ,best it don't heat up like other company (redmi) charger. The charger cable is little lose from usb-A side but not bad.Pip doesn't work anywhere even the option is enable everywhere.Google blocked many feature's by tos.Still waiting for Android 14 or 15 if they ever release , software crashes from time to time beacuse google try to block it someway . in sunlight its not enough brightCamera - only main camera worth 2nd camera is fully useless 3rd camera is just senseor or dummy not sure how i verify it , it pretty much useless. Main can do everything without sensor .Screen on intense task like you're doing many touches in 1 second it dont recognize every touch.

The only Indian smartphone brand which survives and proudly rising in the era of Chinese bombs. In the last few year I have ordered three different Lava smartphones and all are working very good without any issue. The only thing it has to improve is its camera. Otherwise it is a very good budget smartphone for regular use in the present time.

Unique features

Camera Pros and ConCon-Under low light conditions the pictures come out overly lit up, resulting in the images loosing saturation.For example a setting Sun still in the sky having a beautiful orange glow comes out bland with a lightish yellow tint. At other times close up pictures in low light has over saturated colours.Pictures even in normal light conditions are some times bland.Zoomed images are good but macro images are not satisfactory.Interestingly the video images are sharper compared to still photos in both Photo and portrait modes.For example the fine prints on a grocery item pack looks blurry when taken as a still image. Same fine prints when shot close up with video looks amazingly crisp!!Video images are not only crisp but also well saturated under bright ligt conditions. However the colour of the images, especially the green looks highly artificial, tried repeatedly.Pros-Amazingly sharp and crystal clear videos even under medium to low light conditions.The phone video camera completely lives up to its claim of FHD images.A phone with a low price tag of around 11K has such high end tech features like 2 k videos and EIS is unbeleivable.2 k Videos- Not too distinct from the Full HD video output, but still brandishing such high end video quality adds more value to the gadzet. The only down side here is the internal memory card provided.  The Micro SD card is not capable of handling 2k pressure, because of which the 2k videos are jumpy and takes all the fun out of an otherwise sharp featured videos. For K quality videos an sd card of class 10 or above should have been provided.EIS- Electronic image stabilisation is a feature mentioned only with the high end SLRs and prof Video cams. Lava Blaze 5 brandishing EIS feature came as a surprise. CurIOSity got the better of me, and so bought this phone. Videos taken in walking motion comes out smooth with no jerks. Thus EIS makes this phone worth buying, especially for those who are avid video enthusiasts. I think this phone is designed by keeping outdoor vloggers in mind. Serves the purpose!Multitasking: Apart from the camera, one feature I have liked the most is its Background streaming feature, which I am sure many high end 30 K plus phone also dont have in them. So you can browse the net, fiddle around with other apps all the while your you tube podcast is playing in the background.At the end missing my old mobile's capacity to wake up with a gentle tap on the screen. Lava Blaze 5 needs to be pressed at the side to make it wake up. Though the phone is sensitive enough to wake up the moment you lift it from its resting place. But this feature works often when not needed or doesn't work when it should. Not being taken as a con however.

Second time purchased this phone. Really Worth of money
","
First phone purchased in May 2023, my first Lava phone.After a year of using the Lava Blaze 5G, I needed a reliable budget phone and searched online for options. No other phone found except Indian Brand Lava Blaze 5G under Rs.10000, which led me to purchase it again.Pros:Value for Money: Despite being an older model, it offers exceptional value within its price range.5G Experience: Provides a good 5G experience, which is impressive for a budget phone.Performance: Everything works seamlessly, from everyday tasks to more demanding applications.Cons:Old Android Version: The phone comes with an older version of Android. However, this isn't a deal-breaker as all the latest Android versions are quite similar and the phone's performance remains top-notch.Overall, if you are looking for a budget-friendly phone under ‚Çπ10,000, the Lava Blaze 5G is an excellent choice. It's an older model but still worth every single rupee. Highly recommended!

Good for functional (non-gamer, non-selfieCrazy) usage
","
This was the first not-so-great-brand phone that I ever bought, so I waited over six months to post my review.Great phone for the buck, if you are not too picky about extra crisp camera resolutions or if gaming isn't your thing. I would recommend going for the 8Gb and 128Gb model.Been using this phone for over 9 months for primarily business (email/WhatsApp/email/UPI related stuff as well as pdf/document scanning and editing). This phone does a decent job with all that and the battery still lasts over a day, sometimes 2 or 3 days (depending on the intensity of usage)The voice clarity is good, I almost never lost signal on Airtel, even in rural areas or while travelling via road/train. 5G works fine, I rarely use wi-fi and a good mobile data plan connect quite well while on the go. Not sure if this would work the same with online gaming, but this phone isn't designed for that market - lets get honest about that.The camera could have been better, 50 Megapix without the backing optics stunts the camera capabilities especially in long shots and open grounds. The speakers are okay for the price of the product, don't expect Apple/Samsung S series quality sound from this. This is purely functional IMHO, works fine with me.Lava reviews were fairly mixed when I was searching for a low-budget 5G phone in mid-2023, but I took a chance anyway and am quite happy about it.Would certainly recommend this phone if you are a no-nonsense, no-gamingAddict, no-selfieCrazy person and simply looking for an economy level functional phone to last 3-4 years or so.

Likes:1. Indian company and Made in India Tag2. Phone doesn't hang for a decent use.3. Good enough battery backupDislikes:1. Display is useless in sunlight. You can't see anything in bright day light.2. Many times phone says no sim card suddenly and will not accept fingerprint or pin code unless you restart the phone. Recently updated the software, need to see if it is resolved.3. Audio quality is poor. If you attend a phone call on speaker volume is low and will be difficult to hear in noisy areas.Overall looks like it's a below par phone marketed as made in india. Indian customers need quality products even if features are less when we look at budget phones. Not a lemon like the one I have bought. I sincerely hope lava improves it's products. We have very less Indian companies out their making electronics.

All are good except screen. glass is breaking for small drops from hand. it cost 3000 to replace from home visit from Lava team as per call discussion. i am not sure maybe screen is not completely incorporated with side frame protection. apart from this all are good.

Decent phone for decent price ....
","
My samsung phone (M 31) suddenly stopped working at the end of the month, was in a tight budget so took a chance with Lava ... Can say frankly, I am not at all disappointed... Using it for last one month , working just fine ... Iv loaded so many apps still running smoothly...Pros:Value for money pricingFlagship lookDecent build qualityVibration and ring volume is loud enough90 Hz screen is smooth enoughExtremely good battery back up , mine was drained till 10% after 2 days of vigorous use.3.5 headphone jackOther required features are also good.Cons:No fast charging, it takes near about 2.5 hrs to charge is from 10%-100%. The highest input is 15 watt max . You will get a 10 watt charger along with it.The audio out put with the headphones are low and not that much good.Camera is ok for daily use but not at all 50 MP.my biggest disappointment is the secondary camera, it's 8 MP mentioned but performs really bad in low light conditions.Here is the detailed review of the product. Choose according to your needs. For this price or lower, it's value for money.

Top notch for the priceThe first reason people doubt is because of the name LAVA, I also thought the same first, but need to support indian brand,Got it for my father's use - upon using now im jealous that i didn't get one, really impressed üíØ üëçIt has the best 5g speeds you will notice, compared to s23 you will get equal speeds in 5g, With all the 8 5g bands that supports in india.Display: It has hd+ display, If you are using amoled HD+ diaplay you will definitely notice the change but after one day of usage it doesnt even bother you at all.Software: It has android 12 and stock android which is ultimate with zero bloatware, The ui is quiet fast because of the optimization it has no lag whatsoever in the multitasking.- misses little features like extreme customizations ü§≠ but it is sufficientBattery: got a new question - does it discharge, you will feel the same due to 7nm processor and beat software optimization battery backup is ultimateBuilt quality: not less than flagship built, glass back is very good with matte texture, phone is 200g but feels light in hand when holding, edges are good and perfectCamera: doubted the camera but it is beast at this range with enough light it is talking good pictures with heavy aunlight front camera suffers HDR selfies but otherthan every aspect is on par with everyday usePeople generally think with this price range we can go for other brands like redmi or samsung phones, can we trust lava ? these questions .But it is very good alrounder which intake leaps ahead of other options in this price segment, TRUST ME IF THE SAME FEATURES IN SAMSUNG IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE AROUND 16K.As of now there are no bugs in software so i don't update it.got it for 9750[ full payment ] at offer with ICICI CC payment

I bought this product for my mom. I researched alot and then I stuck on this because genuinely speaking I have some redmi mi option instead of this but I thought why not try our Indian product. Trust me every penny is worth it. Beautiful camera. Good storage at this price point. Beautiful design and most importantly in the era where all brands are not providing charger it has beautiful charger and case. I have given 4 star just because the charging time of phone from 1-100% is about 2-3hrs which is too much but then still you can ignore tht because trust me at this price point you won't get a fast charging phone.

The phone runs at lightnIng speed even when he is playing 3-4 large games with graphics. More value for lesser price.

Lava has managed to do what most brands don't do at this price range. It could have been the flagship of budget smartphones. However, there is still a lot to learn in the execution side.Pros:1. Display. Although HD+, it still is one of the best in this price range with 90 Hz refresh rate.2. Bettery Life. An average SOT of 6 hours can be easily drawn even in medium heavy usage.3. Build Quality is just ultimate as one could ask for in a budget smartphone.4. Clean and bloatware free software.Cons:1. Camera. The main camera is just okayish. Rest others are gimmicky. It would have been better if Lava had provided only one main camera with great resolution instead of adding a VGA camera.2. Performance is somewhat a hit and a miss as software seems to lag at some places which makes the usage not that smooth. This can be fixed through software updates.3. Auto-brightness calibration is an issue which I believe exists in almost all Lava smartphones.Overall, a good phone and easily the best for backup/secondary usage purpose.

This phone is perfect for parents who simply want to make calls, use WhatsApp, youtube, etc.. Packaging was good. Phone camera quality is poor. But satisfactory for parents (Subjective).  Speakers are good for the price. Display having a 90hz refresh rate feels smooth. Not crisp but satisfactory. Fingerprint reader is fast. The speed/responsiveness is better for the price. Can go for this instead of overpriced redmi or realme.

FingerPrint sensor is not working properly
","
Finger print sensor is not working properly. Sometimes When I place my finger on the sensor it does not detect the finger and does not vibrate, indicating that sensor is not working properly. Because normally when I place my finger it vibrate and open the screen or just vibrate if wrong finger is placed. Whenever that happens I need to type password to open the screen and then sensor starts working again.  That's the only issue I have.

Bought this for my mom and she is pretty happy with it. Lava is doing a phenomenal job in terms of decent build quality and specs.. in hand feel is very very good.. does look like a premium smartphone, coming to specs it has near bloatware free android 13, good UI, decent battery lifeMajor cons include a little bit sluggish performance (unisoc processor), absence of gallery appConclusion : my main consideration was clean android which is somewhat fulfilled. Also phone is not for heavy usage / gamers / adults who do multitasking. Can be bought as a secondary device !Edit (after two months usage) : there is some problem with phone software as ringtone selected keeps on changing automatically, also settings get changed when phone is rebooted

Overall a good phone, smooth, neat, fluid. But front cam is not so good, usable but not very good as I can take the picture it's looking a bit patchy. I think if they increased the camera quality even increasing the cost of phone a thousand or two if needed, it would have been even better. It's especially true in this era as everyone uses cameras.

Poor reception and frequent call drops - unreliable phone
","
For me, most important feature of a phone is connectivity and call clarity. Unfortunately, Motorola failed in both the fronts.I have used that brick size Motorola, used Motorola Razor but then moved to Nokia and then to Samsung. Was using various Samsung models for more than a decades and gradually felt that both Samsung quality and customer services dropped drastically. Samsung mastered warranty period!! Phone works precisely until the warranty and then fails!! - precision engineering and MTTF!!Thought old, trusted Motorola might have recovered from their initial failures in smartphone and hence gave this Motorola a try.I am using the same sim card, my locations are the same but now my calls are dropping every now and then. My phone is reported as unreachable or switched-off when it is not! I never had call dropping or signal issue earlier with my Samsungs - be it inside lift or in metro!Moreover, Motorola call clarity is below par.Motorola failed miserably in call connectivity and call clarity.Not all are bad, build quality is slightly better, battery and camera is similar.Also, there are just few service centres. So, repair will be a headache if you need it.Overall, not worth for this unreliable phone.

Very bad experience from amazon. Headphone jack stopped working after 2 days. Then after I raised complaint on amazon, they scheduled a technician visit. The technician never showed up, but I got an email that the visit is done. After that I called customer care again and asked what to do next. They said I need to get a defect letter from service center and then they can replace or refund. I asked the authorized service center from where I can get defect letter. But they just kept on hold and then disconnected after some time :(

It impresses the buyer in all segments
","
I am using this Nokia G42 5G phone for the past 4 days and i am happy with its operational outcome. Battery is impressive and comes for a day and half on normal usage. I am using a Airtel Sim which is a 5G ready sim card and the service is not up to the mark as the network juggles between 5G and 4G networks for every 10 minutes. But i am not blaming Nokia for it as it is the network issue of Airtel people and it might improve in coming days.What disappointed me is the camera settings. I thought i will get a 8 and 13MP camera settings along with the 50MP option. But only 50MP camera setting is available on the phone and the images clicked from this phone are Okay. But it does the work for a normal user. And it is irritating when the camera says photo processing is in progress when i need to take continuous quick shots. Furthermore, if the watermark option is enabled, the phone displays that device name and date, but doesn't have the option to display the time of taking the picture and that's a downside as there is no such option in the settings. Night mode captures pictures excellently in dark environments.As i am not a gamer i did not test for the game operations on this phone, yet!YouTube videos are impressive and even i am able to watch 4K videos on this phone. The content on the phone screen is also visible in direct sunlight and so again it went ahead of my expectations.Slight heating is being observed while charging. But not during YouTube video streaming of an hour or so.Charging of the phone is fast, as it charges 30% of phone in just half an hour and takes almost 1 hour 30 minutes to reach from 29% to 100%.It is working fine on my Suzuki Car Infotainment System. As i went for a factory reset of the touchscreen and then my Nokia device started to connect without any trouble.And the single speaker of this phone is also audible and as its placement is at the bottom of the device, the Ringtone sound is loud enough when it rings.I reside in the core of Hyderabad city and the calls are crystal clear as i am using Airtel 5G plus network. Only single sim card slot along with SD Card slot and if you want, you can use that SD Card slot as another sim tray to insert a 4G sim. I guess two 5G sim cards will not work and only 1 5G network will work on this phone.Anyhow, it all depends on the network operator and my Airtel 5G plus network is inconsistent and drops to 4G for every 10 minutes. So, i lodged an immediate online complaint to Airtel people via email and they gave me a time frame of 15 days and assured to provide me a consistent 5G network solution by then....hope so! But still the 4G speed is also good and i can access maps and upload videos and photos quickly to cloud when i am in my house terrace or second floor. After 4 months of this device use, when my phone is on 5G i can experience fast and unlimited downloads. But when it is on 4G it goes through the regular data limit. The Airtel network guys have worked well and have optimized the network to the core at my house and office. But at the rest of the places, only 4G network works and is displayed on the phone and is filled with data download restrictions.Also the power brick supplied has no NOKIA brand name on it, but it does the charging work as per our expectation and mind you, it doesn't have a wireless charging as it is a budget friendly phone.On February 6th, 2024 my device received a Android 14 update and so it received 1OS upgrade  out of 2 as promised.......nice!

A Mixed Bag..!!
","
After using for a day...!!Build quality: A typical Nokia product. In hand feel is good. The back panel looks so much good. Looks awesome.Display: It's doesn't look like a 720p display at all. The overall experience with a 90hz refresh rate is smooth and punchy. But content watching like videos on YouTube may feel little dull.Camera: The 50mp back camera is like 50/50. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's average. I haven't tested the 2mp cameras. 8mp front camera is below average. Camera app has some cool features. Use GCam for a good result. Picture quality will be improved drastically especially the front camera.Speaker: The single bottom firing speaker is loud and has good level of vocal details. But misses the bass. Overall average. It has a feature call boost volume which will increase the volume upto 10%. The earpiece is top quality. Wired earphone output is good. I've used Nokia earphones and quality is good. Also used Noise tws and got a decent output, no issues here.Software: Clean Android 13 with some pre installed app which is uninstallable.Overall a good phone in this price range. 5G bands only n28 and n78 available. Airtel 5G is working fine, don't know about Jio. Compass sensor is missing. I've also attached some shots taken with Nokia G42 5G. Charging the battery will take 1hr45mins from 20% to 100%.

[Edit 19-Oct-2024:] Android not updating issue seems to be resolved
","
Model: Nokia G42 5G TA-1586 DS 6/128EDIT (19-Oct-2024):------------------------Finally, after multiple emails and chats with HMD support/ Nokia Care, received the 00WW_2_350 build update via OTA for my device. Now that HMD has fixed some OTA related bug at their end, hopefully all future OTA updates will be received smoothly as and when they are released.Bumping up the stars to 4 as the OTA update issue seems to have been resolved.Aside from that the phone is pretty stable & reliable and meets my performance requirements.---------------------------------------------------One star because of the experience in dealing with Amazon customer care, specialist support, Nokia customer care and technical support and Amazon Home services.The phone on first power-on after unboxing had October 2023 as the OS version. Then it got updated to the December 2023 security patch.All further checks for update just show that the ""System is already up to date"" and no other updates are available. Due to this, its still.stuck at Android 13 with December 2023 security patch. This is despite the latest available OS update as per the Nokia website is June 2024 security patch.Tried many troubleshooting steps like clearing the storage and cache of some system apps and finally factory resetting the phone; but no change in the situation.Called Nokia customer care and technical support; looks like they know customers have reported this issue previously but they are not openly disclosing what the actual problem is and are asking me to visit the service center.Asked Amazon customer care for replacement, but there is no useful support from Amazon and they are washing their hands off saying the policy available for this phone is only brand service center replacement within 7 days. If Amazon is to issue refund or replacement, then I need to get a denial letter from the service center.Called Nokia customer care again and they are adamant that I visit the service center andThis issue of a simple OTA update (that should ""just work"" out of the box) for a freshly unboxed phone on the first day itself should be eligible for a replacement from Amazon.If I visit the Nokia service centre, they might have the tools to manually flash the latest OS rom image. But who knows this issue will occur again or not ?This phone is supposed to get monthly security updates. So if the OTA updates are not working, are we to visit the service center every time to let them flash the newest updates ?

Good phone for the price

Its not very thin - hence slightly heavier.The latest Android UI (or maybe its this phone's UI / theme) is bit non intuitive for me (for example - the close all button for apps appears after scrolling all open apps horizontally - which is problematic.I am facing problems in microphone quality in recording videos - there is lot of noise - only in this phone (other android phones I have work fine). I think this might have to do that they have some AI sound optimization in default camera's sound recording - which perhaps is buggy. Or maybe its the hardware.The camera quality is very good for this price range. Though I think - there is again some AI/other optimization  in images which reduces naturalness of the photos in certain situations.Basically they should have provided more control over whether we want the audio/video enhancer.The phone is otherwise very fast - faster than perhaps some other models in this range.

It seems that Nokia is back! Awesome budget smart phone.I am using it from last 2 weeks and find it very good.Pls note that there are some controls which are different than other vendor android phones but I find it more better in this phone and anyone can adjust to them in 15-20 minutes.26/09/24: Putting this comment after 3 weeks of initial feedback. I saw one issue in the phone, sometimes the other party not able to hear my voice and need to reconnect again. I initially feel that was a Nw issue but not very sure its a phone issue.

Processor and Battery: Device's Prowess, Screen and Design are not.
","
Used this phone for over a month now, here are pros and cons:Pros1. Decent Battery, with minimal use 3 days backup, moderate use 2 days backup, heavy use 1 Day backup.2. Process handling, It can handle games like COD mobile and Genshin Impact and warms up, doesn't heat.Cons1. Aesthetics feel awful, the back is purple, it looks good, really. But the side is colored grey/silver and feels out of place. Yes I had to include this2. The screen is weird, you can not get a single tampered glass to fit on it perfectly. they do not adhere to the edges of the screen and this is definitely a problem with the screen, not tampered glass.3. Update made the fingerprint sensor misbehave so I had to restart the phone and register fingerprint again for it to work again.4. Camera quality with dim light, nothing to brag about, even my Nokia 5.1 plus from 5 years ago took far decent photos than this ""50 MP AI cam"". In VERY bright light I can say yep, its really good.5. UI is extremely restrictive, I wonder if that's just with one UI or all Android 13 devices. You can not customize much.6. Installs bloatware when you first connect to the internet even though it was mentioned somewhere that you only get stock android, or I probably mixed a few things idk?7. Side mounted fingerprint sensor is annoying. Its placement makes it harder to avoid unlocking the device when you are trying to lift it up or shove it in your pocket.8. Its too big, doesn't fit in most pockets, due to large screen size, UI looks pretty ugly. Specially due to the large margins for each icon/ element in Android 13 it looks awfully hideous. On that note, I must mention that it even fell once out of my pocket, 2.5 feet height may be? I had tampered on, no damage on anything though. I was using a wired headphone that got stuck somewhere and funnily, instead of the headphones falling down, it was the phone that leapt out.9. The camera at one side raises it from that side so it is wobbly when sitting on a plane surface.10. Things not mentioned are just average as you get in any 8-10K phone.Conclusion: This phone has a LOT of design flaws, they tried but failed. I would say it is priced OK given the CPU which I really liked and the battery life which is awesome as well. You can get a better phone at the same price, its just that, being Nokia, it is probably more durable than the others at the same price. So if you are looking for a phone that you can throw in frustration (not too hard), play high end games (not too high end, and not keep a lot of them at the same time), don't care about the camera or photo quality, need long lasting battery and are ready to pay a price which this device is unworthy for, then go for it. Otherwise there are decent alternatives available with only one concern with them, built quality.

The handset I received does not have NFC. I checked the settings carefully on the connected device, and everything. But there is no NFC? What's the matter? What to do?Edit: Customer care clarified that NFC is not available in handsets in India.Otherwise, the customer care of HMD/NOKIA seems untrained and lazy. I asked questions about the security updates for my phone as security updates have not been provided after Jan. 24. The customer care gave false and misleading answers and then asked me to go to customer care. service centre is too far away from me.Later, after many days, I looked at the Android website carefully for security updates - and realised that for the build number I have, security updates have not been released after Jan. 2024 by the Android itself.The customer care centre associate = did not clarify this. They are not trained. Most importantly, the Customer care associate gave false information that security updates had been stopped after the customer complained about problems with their phone.Ed

1st look is very fine, An Adapter & Charging cable are also provided which is good. Performance & Battery is good.  A handy interface needs to be used for some time for final review. The back button is given on the left side instead of the right side. 1-plus point is that the Company also provides you cover and the Screen is already protected by Gorilla glass 3. My MOTHER is happy with this phone. Some other competent brand has lower prices but we can rely on them as it is Nokia. VERY SLIM.

First of all, I was terrified to buy this smart phone seeing everybody's review on amazon that totally breaks Nokia's reputation.Nothing was good enough and I had already fixed my mind to buy this phone. Everybody was commenting unnecessarily without technical details.The Phone I received was manufactured in July 2024 and came to me. It wasn't tampered which I could see for myself with the void seal. It's just good.Now for the heating issue. It is a phone that supports Fast Charging. It did heat up for me during the very first charge but in the subsequent charging cycles. It didn't heat much only at certain points about 70% even then, it reduced its heat when I took the phone off of the charger when it's fully charged.For the software side of things, everything is good. Stock Android, the main key point I bought this phone. It's just perfect.The Virtual RAM is so good that I never clear my recent apps. It's just works snappily.Only thing is, Security update was at January 2024. But as per Nokia's policy it should have given me the update for July 2024/May 2024. Another phone at home which is also Nokia receives timely montly security updates.I guess it's possibly because, I received at the end of the month and the update cycle for this is pushed to the next month. Will update if it's the case as I guessed.The Speakers are a blast with Ozo Audio both in Media and Phone calls.If you see, reviews that say heating, not working, refund my money, etc. Just ignore it and place your trust blindly on Nokia.P.S. for the above kind of reviews, I think amazon should mainly remove the ""refund my money"" or allow them to post it and reply, Please contact the Device Manufacturer's service center. If reviews are manually reviewed instead of machine made.

I have been using the phone for the last three months and I must say I am impressed! I bought this phone as a standby phone and within two months it has now become my main phone.I went in with very little expectations - Stock Android, good battery life and and the Nokia build quality. Not only does the phone meet these expectations it exceeds them on every count.The battery actually lasts for over 2 days and the stock Android is a great performer making all apps work faster than the bloatware hampered workings of the other phones And, not forget a decent camera quality. Especially the potraits are stunning and detailed with no pixalation.I still can't believe that it costed only 12,500! So to summarise, if you are looking for an Android workhorse that has dependable (long) battery life,stock Android with no bloatware and excellent build quality all under 15,000 bucks, this one's the phone for you!

I have been using this since last month. I appreciate this product as it is made in India. I would like to share my experience with the product...Pros:1. Its camera quality is really appreciable. Actually I liked it considering it's price.2.Screen sensitivity alongwith the refresh rate is really upto the mark for aged people who in general don't use smart phone that much.3. It's interface is very good as it is easy to navigate.4. No or very less heating during charging, long time telephonic conversation, or usage of multiple apps simultaneously.Cons:1. The only flaw I came to know is it's exterior screen design which is minutely curved causing Formation of Multiple Air Bubbles on sides of the phone when I want to paste screen guard. It doesn't matter if the protector is from the company or externally bought, the result is same.2. CPU refresh rate should have been more as it feels slow when you want to open and operate multiple apps simultaneously like today's Indian youth wants to do.Note:- I don't play games in general so I not commenting on that.

I am writing this review after using this phone for a month.Pros:1. Emotional touch with NOKIA, hence could not resist in buying2. Touch is OK3. Battery is quite good, almost 2 daysCons:1. Inbuilt Netflix does not get updated, required to uninstall and then install and then it works2. Very long time for booting3. The sound during booting is very low quality4. Camera not that good, but it's OK, can't expect more at this price5. Touch sensitivity is poor, it lags sometimes6. Sometimes the screen does not respond to touch7. Finally, the most important bug - Purchases this phone in July, on first setup, saw it was Android 13 with Oct 2023 security patch. Updated via OTA for Dec 2023 patch. After that, no OTA updates are coming though Nokia website talks about Android 14 being pushed since January 2024 and many people are having in this phone July 2024 security patches. Talked with CC but they say only option is to wait and continue clicking Software update option. Also there is no way to update the software through sideloading or ADB or fastboot or Recovery....this is really absurdAmazon should do someting about this, either technical help or replacement

If you're in the market for a phone that excels in both performance and photography, this model is a compelling choice. As an ACE Dominator-Masters player, I can confidently say that this phone offers a stable gaming experience with minimal lag. It handles heavy gaming well, with only occasional lag when the server conditions are poor. The touch response is impressive, making it a solid option for competitive play.The camera quality is surprisingly good, capturing clear and vibrant photos, which is perfect for heavy camera usage. Social media enthusiasts will also appreciate its performance in this area.However, there are a few drawbacks. The phone tends to get quite warm, especially when using the 120Hz refresh rate and full brightness. While this is manageable and doesn't affect the overall experience too much, it‚Äôs something to be aware of. Additionally, the UI stability seems to have taken a hit after the recent update, making the phone feel less enjoyable to use compared to before.Overall, this phone is a strong contender for those who need a device that performs well in gaming, photography, and social media, despite a few minor drawbacks.

This phone is for you if you are looking for a sturdy, smart and practical phone with a neat user experience. The phone surely feels premium in hand and looks distinct from other devices.UI is amazing. No bloatware, clean design and lot of emphasis on practicality and user friendliness.Another department where phone scores very high is it's battery. It easily last for 2 days if you are an average user.The only area where phone underperforms is the camera. Despite good specs , the image quality is snot consistent. Colours are often saturated (even after the latest update) and the edge detection in potrait mode is still a struggle. Hopefully Nothing team will roll out more updates to improve and stablize the camera of the phone.Overall, a great product at this price point.

Excellent Phone, value for money
","
I have been using this phone since last 1 month and everything this is working fine on an average use of 4-5 hours a day.Battery backup is also good and I usually charge the phone once in 2 days.Camera quality is also good as compared to the price and phone is also fast.Phone Design is fabulous ü§© and it gives you an altogether different feel.Phone weight is equally distributed so doesn't feel heavy while using.

Extremely Dissatisfied with Amazon's Service and Product Quality
","
Dear Amazon Customer Service,I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the service I have received regarding my recent purchase of the Nothing 2A phone. Despite assurances from your mobile inspection team that my concerns would be addressed promptly, I have encountered nothing but frustration and unfulfilled promises.I purchased the Nothing 2A phone expecting a certain standard of quality, particularly in its camera capabilities. Upon realizing the camera did not meet my expectations, I promptly initiated a return request. Despite the initial confirmation from your team, there has been an alarming lack of follow-through on Amazon's part.For over 6-7 days, I patiently waited for a call to arrange the return pick-up, only to receive none. Your application, which I attempted to use for customer service, failed to connect me, highlighting serious deficiencies in its functionality. It took a staggering 10 days of persistent effort via your website before I was finally able to speak with someone.To my disbelief, the response I received was that Amazon could no longer assist with a return or replacement. This level of incompetence and indifference is simply unacceptable from a company of Amazon's stature.My experience with Amazon's handling of this matter has been nothing short of a nightmare. I have been left with a defective product and no recourse for resolution. As a loyal customer who has relied on Amazon for years, this experience has shattered my trust and left me questioning whether I can continue to support your platform.I urge Amazon to seriously reconsider its policies and procedures for handling customer complaints and returns. There needs to be accountability for the promises made to customers and a genuine effort to rectify situations when they fail to meet expectations.In conclusion, I demand a full refund for the Nothing 2A phone and a formal apology for the way this matter has been mishandled. If Amazon hopes to retain my trust and loyalty as a customer, swift action is needed to address these concerns.Sincerely,Sowmya

Very nice phone but no charger
","
The phone is really good. I have received many compliments from people about this phone. The user experience is also very good. I like the symmetrical bezels around the screen, makes it look really premium, the screen is sharp and adequately bright, the interface is really smooth, I wouldn't say it's fast but it gets the job done, I'm coming from a OP 5T, so this phone with its 120HZ screen does look faster than my old phone, I do know it's limitations and I'm okay with the compramises made to make it a well rounded package at an affordable price. I would have given 5/5 stars, but no company is perfect. -1 star for not having a charger in the box, I had to spend an additional 2k for a compatible 45w charger on Amazon. I would have been more than happy to pay that additional amount for the phone if they had included a compatible Nothing charger in the box. Now I'm using a good quality Amazon basics charger, Nothing should start including a compatible charger in the box, or let the customer pick if they want a charger bundled in the box. Just like how they pick the storage space they want on the phone, charge the customer an additional 1k or 1.5k for the charger to be included in the box, so customer who actually need a charger would still have the option to get a phone with its compatible charger from the company instead of scouring through the internet for hours to find a reliable charger with good reviews that is compatible with the phone, just an unwanted tension/hassle in my opinion.

this is a good phone, decent processor, extremely good os, decent cameras and if you want to game it doesn't run that hot. However I would appreciated a charger and a bit better specs for this phone. Also would have wished it came with ufs 3.0 but not really a deal breaker for me. Dont use the preapplied screen protector , it is fragile so just get a new one. Tldr: good phone for everyday casual use, get it if you want a good os system, clean phone and fast charging with the nothing gimmicky glyph lighting, go for it Can say it's worth, unless if you only want gaming phone then go for poco x6 pro, sacrificing basically everything expect the processor.

0,OnePlus 12R (Sunset Dune),Shahzad Ahmad,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 7 March 2024,"5.0 out of 5 stars
A flagship performer without the flagship price.
","
Easily one of the best purchases that I have made and well worth its price.Pros:- SD 8 Gen 2 is fast and very power efficient. The performance is indistinguishable in day to day usage when compared to SD 8 Gen 3 on a OnePlus 12 with UFS 4.0. Even though the 12R has a UFS 3.1 storage, you are unlikely to notice any difference whatsoever without running benchmarks or checking the specifications. In real life day to day usage, I have not found any difference and I am a power user who uses a lot of applications and use the phone over 8 Hours a day.- The vapour chamber handles the cooling very well which keeps the device at excellent temperature even when playing games for an extended duration. It almost never goes over 38c.- The display has the same features as the OnePlus 12 (the resolution is relatively lower but it's not noticeable to the naked eye without magnification) and this is one of the best displays that you will come across. The HDR performance is also some of the best I have seen and it is a completely different experience. This can also be seen in the HDR shots taken with cameras. I'd suggest going to a OnePlus experience center and searching for 12K HDR videos on YouTube to get a better idea. Note that the 4,500 nits mentioned is only the HDR brightness at a small white portion of the display under sunlight. This is NOT the max brightness of the full display. But it is bright enough to use under direct sunlight.- Battery life is very impressive with over 8 hours of SOT and the 100W included charger fully charges it in about 35 mins.- Also love that the display can be used even when your hands are wet unlike most other smartphones- The bezels are extremely slim and the chin is smaller than the one on the OnePlus 12. I do wish it was equal all around though.Rather than cons, I'll just mention what it lacks.- Wireless charging- Telephoto cameraThat's pretty much it. If you are looking for a smooth and reliable device with solid performance, battery life, fast charging, decent cameras and display experience, I would easily recommend this. Sure the cameras may not be as good as an iPhone 15 (81k) or a Pixel 8 (83k) but they also cost around 80% more than the OnePlus 12R.

Fantastic Phone After a Week of Use!
","
I‚Äôve been using the OnePlus 12R (Iron Gray, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB Storage) for a week now, and it‚Äôs been an amazing experience so far!Design & Feel:The Iron Gray color looks really sleek, and the phone feels great in the hand. It‚Äôs light, and slim, and the metal finish gives it a premium feel. I‚Äôve gotten a few compliments on how good it looks!Performance:This phone is super fast. I‚Äôve been using it for gaming, browsing, and even some work, and it handles everything like a pro. No lag, no stuttering ‚Äî everything runs so smoothly. The 8 GB RAM really shows its power when multitasking.Display:The AMOLED screen is beautiful! Watching videos and scrolling through social media is a real treat. The colors are bright and vibrant, and the smooth 120Hz refresh rate makes everything feel so responsive.Battery Life:The battery easily lasts me the whole day stiil I have around 20-25% left, even with heavy use. I also love how fast it charges ‚Äî the SUPERVOOC charging gets me back to 100% in about 25-30 minutes, which is super convenient. But I guess, better to use slow charger day to day to increase battery life and use the SUPERVOOC only when you need it urgently.Camera:I was skeptic about 12R vs Realme GT 6T vs Pixel 8A. After a thorough review and physical check, the dynamic range is better in 12R. Pixel is also a great camera but has a small battery backup compared to 12R. I can vouch that 12R will not disappoint you with its overall performance. I‚Äôve taken some really sharp and detailed photos, and the portrait mode is a lot of fun. Even in low light, the pictures come out pretty good.Software:I love how clean and simple the OxygenOS is. It‚Äôs easy to navigate and doesn‚Äôt come with a lot of pre-installed apps I don‚Äôt need. Everything just works smoothly, and I‚Äôve had no issues so far.After 7 days, I‚Äôm really happy with the OnePlus 12R. It feels like a flagship phone at the price. Definitely a great choice if you‚Äôre looking for a reliable camera, battery backup, feature-packed, good-looking phone!

The phone comes along with an 100W charger, and back case.

And build quality is commentable.The call quality and network seems to be very good. I am getting a better network and speed compared to pther phones.I am not a gamer to comment on heating. With normal use i didnt face any heating issue.The fingerprint sensor response is very fast. I installed a curved tempered glass  from a local store. And i didnt face any ossue with fingerprint sensor.I loved both the front and back camera. The post processed image seems to add some real good beauty similar to iphone.The display is awesome.  Due to high refresh rate i didnt see any lag in playing 4k videos. The display is very smooth too.The speaker quality is also really nice. It is loud enough and the bass also seems to be fine

Performance with aesthetic phone
","
Pros1. Display : OnePlus did a fantastic job in this area with a¬†beautiful bright display and curves at the corners. Looks premium and definitely stands apart from other phones.2. Charger : We will get a 100 watt charger along with the phone having amazing charging speed. Many premium smartphones don't give a¬†charger in the box and lack fast charging support also.3. Battery : I am impressed with SOT with almost 6 to 7 hrs. Even though I do a heavy use it will still last me a whole day.4. Performance : No lags handle multi-tasking with ease. Fast and smooth to use most of the apps.¬†5. Build quality : Made of metal frame and very solid which is good but feels heavy to keep in pocket. I got a sunset dune colour which is unique and pleasant.6. Oxygen OS gives us pure stock android experience without any unnecessary adware.Cons :1. The Handset is slippery to hold without any case. I personally use a bumper case to secure it.2. The camera may not be compared with apple phones but it is still much better than previous OnePlus phones.

Pretty fantastic considering the price
","
This phone is pretty amazing have had an amazing battery life (4+ hrs on 50% battery), charges quickly (30 mins, rapid charging), great display (full resolution not the basic one), great network bands (5G) and rock solid performance (Geekbench: 2K single, 5K multi). The main camera lens is good but the rest of the lenses; I would say average and sometimes annoying in artificial lights - a little light and it doesn't do even a decent job, front camera is okay. But, considering the price (I paid 35k INR, 8gb+256gb) I don't think there can be anything better than this. Maybe S23 is a better option if you want a better camera around this range but maybe 5-6k higher than this if you want 256gb. I didn't want 16GB ram on this as I don't think I need it and I don't think anyone does for now. I have used an iPhone 15 128gb earlier this year. Maybe my standards for camera are high. But, let's be honest; value is great for the price. Go for it, safe bet for 2 years. I might switch after 1-2 years. Oh yeah, doesn't heat; only slightly that too while charging; again it is a 100W charger. Butter smooth scrolling as it supports LTPO & fingerprint scanner is quick too. 4 stars cause camera might disappoint you. I suggest you to consider this, if under 35K INR and that too 256+8!

I purchased the one plus 12r a few days ago and have some mixed opinions on this productPros1. Really nice camera. The pictures are crisp and sharp. Zoom is also pretty good.2. Good for gaming. I do not face any lags when the setting are on high and the details of the game look much clearer.3. Look and feel of the phone physically is great.4. Charging is pretty good. Love the fast charging of one plus and the battery life is pretty good tooCons1. The UI isn't the best. My old phone was a Samsung and the amount of customisation I used to have doesn't even compare to one plus. I really wanted to switch back to my old phone just for this one problem. If your used to a Samsung phone this phone will disappoint you.

Have been using it for 4 months. Battery on moderate usage (browsing, watching videos, reading ebooks and a bit of social media scrolling) lasts one complete day with 20- 25% remaining. Charges superfast. Camera in day light is excellent. It is very good in low light modes. These are stand alone statements and not comparing with other mobiles. 16GB RAM keeps apps open in background (sometimes for a day or more). As I don't game, no heating noted. Display is great. If you have small hands, you might find usage tricky but not a very bulky phone. With promised updates, should last 3 years at least

Good phone based on the finest 4nm SOC based on TSMC foundry-Snapdragon 8 gen 2 which is quite snappy.Can achieve SOT of abiut 12 hours for non gaming use with deep app -battery customization, disabling or debloating system apps, refresh rate, screen redolution adjustment which I consider super excellent. This is the only smartphone rated for one of the highest battery stamina score of 20 hours in PC Mark Battery test and is what convinced me to purchase it though I dislike curved screens.Vibration motor delivers tight bursts of high frequency vibrations and am loving it.Tons of customization option to optimize user experience. However the Oxygen OS severely lacs bold personality like the Samsung UI.1 BBK bloatware -""Heytap Cloud"" is present apart from unwanted & un unstallable Google apps, which is not a good thing on a flagship killer Oneplus smartphone. It may have it's servers possibly in China so be wary. So I deducted 1 star. Despite disabling it, it sends out connection request which is kind of malicious. So far, have blocked it with a firewall.Have to hunt for a good screen guard now.Have to see if screen develops a green line or motherboard conks off in the future. I bought an extended warranty of 1 year for this purpose.

My word of advice.. stay away from buying phones on Amazon!!!I was recently delivered a defective one plus 12R that won't even turn on and Amazon has entirely shirked their responsibility. They washed their hands off claiming it's a One plus issue, and I need to deal this directly with the manufacturer. They won't let you return/replace it or take any action for that matter. Apparently, it's clearly mentioned in their policy that Amazon is not responsible for defective products even if it arrives Dead. Beware of this interesting clause guys!!!!If you‚Äôre unlucky enough to get a faulty device, brace yourself for a nightmare. Be prepared to be put on hold for hours and hours, transferred through never ending loops of mind games, bad attitudes and utmost unprofessional behaviour of the Amazon staff.. ranging from the agents to technicians to leadership team. This ridiculous drama will drag on for days, driving you to the brink of insanity - forcing you to either give up or become one of them... Insane! I chose the former and now find myself with a non-working phone, a loss of 45k INR, and just a sliver of sanity left!To be honest, I‚Äôve always bought all my phones and gadgets from Amazon. However, I feel compelled to write this not just because of a one-off bad experience, but because I‚Äôve realized that this is a widespread issue. Countless others have faced this nightmare, particularly during a ""SALE"".Do yourself a favor: don‚Äôt waste your money here. Go to a showroom!Good luck guys!

I got the delivery on time with the original Box and Seal and the product. Now about the OnePlus 12R it's a silent-killer phone in speed, weight and feel in hand a good Value for money. It's fingerprint reader amazingly fast response. The functionality is superb with a massive 3.2Ghz clock speed Snapdragon 8Gen2. The feel of OnePlus 12R is premium and luxury in hand. My final verdicts are:CAMERA : Above average. Portrait mode too good. Night mode is ok. Dynamic and wide angle can be more good in future update as I hope.CHARGING & BATTERY: Like Nord series this also have 5500mAh and comes easily 1 and half for me under 5G for 7 hrs or mild gaming. There is no idle discharge also. 100% charging happens in just 12 to 13 minutes with Ultra Fast 100w charger thanks to OnePlus they give it in the box only.DISPLAY: Its LTPO4 Amoled and immersive feel of color and subject be movie watching or gaming the Display of OnePlus 12R will attract you more and more.BUILD & BODY: Looks sturdy üí™ and it is durable also the way it looks with Waterproof and dust proof you don't need to bother for splashes of rain water etc. Moreover OnePlus is giving one Backcase in box also.RAM: I loved the ram management of OnePlus 12R it's not heating or lagging at all, even during 60fps gaming or multitasking or even video editing also. Only on charging only it heats but overall during the gaming it's not heating that much. Ram expansion feature makes the mobile more battery efficient.NETWORK: Till date I have not faced any call drops or Wifi Break in middle. Even wirless bluetooth earbuds calling also too good and stereophonic.SOUND & HAPTICS: Dual Stereo Speakers and Dolby sound makes the music on the go nice and loud and mild bass and crisp clear. The HAPTICS of OnePlus 12R is truly impressive with its O Engine feature. The typing is a boon on it with fluid speed and every word auto-correction feature that enables a fast typing as well as 99% accuracy.At the end I can easily say that it's a premium smartphone as per the price, with its fully loaded AI features with a new 2.26Gb update, it is well justified. Every phone has a CONS & PROS but about OnePlus 12R it's Cons are less for example - it can be IP67 rest I am not finding any cons as per budget I have paid.Highly recommended.

","
Was an Apple user for 3 years and finally exchanged my iPhone 12 for this and I'm happy with my decision.In Every department such as Display, Design, Performance, Battery,  it's like an ANDROID FLAGSHIP LEVEL (I'm a non-Camera guy so I would say it's camera's are bit okaish, it would be excellent if telephoto was there instead of macro).But one thing I noticed is that as an APPLE user, software on this phone is really nice but it could have been done better on some areas for better overall Flagship Premium experience.Just a hope guys but If the OnePlus team really brings back the OG OxygenOS to it's future models (or atleast differentiate it's OS from the ColourOS-ish) then ohh boyy.... this phone or the future models will smoke the Indian Smartphone market for a long long time.

1. in-hand feel is great2. Screen is too good 1.5k screen3. Good experience in viewing video content4. Camera is good but not the best in this price range but definitely one plus has improved in camera department.5. Finnest OS ever I used . Kudos to oxygen OS6. Battery is the beast üí™ üí™  5500 mah is sufficient for a day even if you are heavy user7. Though it's a big screen but doesn't heats up at all . Might be it's a new phone . Will update after using couple of  months üòÉ8. Feels not heavy at all but it's actual weight is 209 gm . Weight management is jabardast9. Not recommended for femalebor if you have small finger as it is a big phone10.

I bought this phone at 19k, and for this money this is a good phone. Ticks all the right boxes, has all the required things like charger, cable, case and screenguard in the box unlike some other companies. Gray back is shimmery, looks cool. Phone is lightweight despite big battery. Charging speed is lightning quick and battery runs long enough. OS is smooth, got 3-4 updates just after setting up. Camera is fine too, no complains. Casual games run smooth, haven't tried any heavy game which I anyway don't play.Two observations though:1. Battery sticks at 100% for a very long time, which is strange and not accurate. But overall battery backup is good. See the screenshot.2. It's good it supports HDR on Netflix and Prime etc, and has a toggle for make the screen bright when playing HDR content. But it doesn't work at all. If your screen is dim it remains dim. You have to manually push the light level to the max. In general auto light sensor keeps the screen a bit dim for my liking, and unlike my Samsung Galaxy S20, it doesn't remember if I have increased the level, it still keep diming the screen to preset level. In my Samsung, the auto level changes the light including manual inputs so I don't have to fiddle with it very often.Upart from these two niggles, phone is good. Don't exact too much from the camera though. It's average.

So this phone is a best phone for all aspects.1- Best performance for gaming I have tested with bgmi , class of clan , call of duty, Mobile legends etc .2- Above average camera which will give you good image in day light condition because it have premium sony sensor.3- You can get high quality stability in video also due to its OIS feature so it is good for bloggers and it supports slow motion in 240 fps .4- It is giving me 10-12 hour battery backup with normal use but when it comes to gaming it gives 5-7 hour but it is not a deal breaker because in those 5 hours you will get best gaming experience and in only 30 mint you can charge 100 % this mobile with its 80 w fast charger.5- It have its brand value with red cable card , 5 g stable network connectivity, Vo lte , wifi , nfc , bluetooth , ir blaster , Dolby Atmos6- It will gives you premium level haptics due to its O-haptic motor .7- Premium quality amoled display which will give you best viewing experience with 120 fps but feels little dull in direct sun light due to 950 nits peak brightness.8- One thing is missing i.e 3.5 mm jack but in my case I have bluetooth ear bud so it's okay for me.9- OnePlus gives best after sell service , one example is free display change if you will get green line issue but in my case I have not experienced that .10- It will give you quick software update for 3 years and 2 major update.I think this is enough to go with this phone cuz in 19 k budget you will not get a better deal than this.

Decent OnePlus phone under 30k Segment
","
Have been using the phone for over a week now.Positives:1. Snapdragon 782 processor is quite good. There is no lag whatsoever even on opening multiple apps and using for a long time.2. Battery life is decent. It is definitely not a gaming mobile.3. 5G services are accessible in most locations(in Hyderabad) wherever there is network.4. Both front and rear cameras are decent. You can click good shots in Night mode as well. Photos taken in various modes viz., Macro, Extra HD, Night, Pro, Potrait are attached.5. 80W fast charging is electric! I was able to charge my mobile from 23% to 100% in 17-18 mins and from 4% to 100% in 22-23 mins.6. Audio and video quality is great. Get some good earphones and you will experience the theatre effect with Dolby sound.7. No heating issue of any kind even after continuous usage/a long phone call.8. 12 GB RAM is great. You can now multitask and open apps simultaneously.Negatives:1. Battery drains fast. Should have been built to last longer. Like I said, definitely not a gamer's mobile. However, phone will last for a day even with heavy usage.2. Flagship 50MP Sony camera is a disappointment. Definitely not what an amateur photographer would expect. The moment you zoom in, image gets blurred and pixelated. Expected a much better camera from a mid premium mobile at priced at 30k3. Most of the features were toned down from other premium versions of OnePlus. However, one would expect some premium features when spending almost 30k.4. Back cover and screen guard are useless. Expected OnePlus to provide decent good quality default screen guard and phone cases. Please do buy both separately.5. Audio/Video seems to just stop and then play on using YouTube. Might have to update the app and check if it is an issue with the device.6. Absence of a 3.5mm audio jack is a big drawback for wired earphone users.Update 1 : Have received the first update to Oxygen 13.1 within 2-3 days of purchase wherein video quality of camera and few other features were improved. Also, the video lag issue is now resolved.Update 2: Received second software update on 23 Aug 2023 which is aimed at improving front/rear camera picture quality and optimizing the battery of the mobile when it is at rest.Update 3: Received another software upgrade in early October aimed at enhancing Network connectivity and stabilization.Update 4: Received Android 14 software upgrade on Jan 12 2024. Device is now stable.Overall a decent buy under 30k segment. Expected better features from a premium smartphone but certainly not a big disappointment. Overall 4 stars. I would recommend this mobile to others.

Highly recommended. Performance guaranteed phone.
","
Go for it blindly. I've used Samsung, Realme, Xiaomi, Micromax, Nokia, Vivo and Sony Xperia in past but no one comes close to OnePlus in the smoothness and user interference. Completely in awe with this phone.Pros:-1. Camera is superb,image produce natural colour. At this price point only a few Realme phones with Sony sensor come close. otherwise Poco,Oppo, Xiaomi produce filtered and sharpened images.2. Performance is smooth. It doesn't lag even once. For day to day task you can opt blindly. Good for gaming & multitasking.3. Display is bright enough to use outdoor even in direct sunlight. Video clarity is superb.4. Sound is clear & loud. Call is loud enough that you can hear without placing phone on your ear5. Battery takes around 25-30 min to charge from 0% to 100%. It last 1.5 days easily with moderate use. I've watched 2 movies on OTT in single charge and still 50% battery remaining.6. No bloatware, no unwanted app preloaded.Cons:-1. Phone heats a little during charge, but cool down instantly when you unplug the charger.2. Applock doesn't lock setting.3. Phone is lightweight and slippery. Place back cover with good grip.4. Made with plastic, feels gentle.

Delivery system needs improvement
","
Writing this review after 8 months usage:Solid phone with excellent camera.Ultra fast charging speed but battery drains faster as well.Fast processing speed.Very light weight phone.Full value for money phone.But not satisfied with Amazon delivery system. The delivery boy took 700 rupees extra as he was not satisfied with the phone condition to be exchanged but never provided any receipt for extra payment. He said it will be updated in your invoice.Charging extra payment is not the problem as it is possible if phone condition is not up to mark, but not providing any receipt is a big problem. Neither the extra payment of 700 rupees was mentioned in the invoice nor my invoice was updated.Rest the phone is brilliant.

Overpriced, but offers good value in this range
","
The OnePlus Nord CE 3 (ONCE3) took its time convincing me of earning the successor's role from my Xiaomi Note 7 Pro.Honestly, this doesn't feel like much of an upgrade from the Note 7 Pro that's over 4 years old now. Sure the storage size and RAM are higher, the SoC is more current generation and has an in-display finger print sensor. I'd waited for a good successor to the Note 7 Pro for years and I had to finally compromise with this phone sacrificing a headphone jack that I miss on a daily basis.Pictures from this phone and my erstwhile RN7pro deliver comparable quality shots. The difference is mostly in post processing and response but in quality, there's barely a 4 years' refinement. Even in good daylight shots from the primary camera, the images look poorly captured, sharpened with no resemblance to the textures as perceived in reality and the 50 MP image does very little to enhance visual quality.I don't want to repetitively make this comparison because it's a niche audience it'll apply to, but the 12MP to 48MP pixel binned images that the RN7Pro offered 4 years ago is a lot more impressive TODAY than the ONCE3's 50MP and its economical 12.3MP standard framing.The ONCE3's reasonably good Camera reviews, Snapdragon chipset for GCAM, presence of an IR blaster and in-display fingerprint sensor, the charging support with an included 80W fast charger and expandable storage are the reasons why I chose this phone. The current gen Redmi Note 13 series failed to make sense, was overpriced and I didn't want to encourage that trend.Since buying and using the ONCE3, the things I liked about the phone are the design, the in-hand feel, the haptic feedback quality, the display quality and the stereo speakers' quality.Things I found disappointing in this phone apart from the mediocre performing Camera are mostly of the Oxygen OS. Though there aren't any bloatware, these things really made for a poor impression:The fonts aren't really enough for someone like me who wants a no-nonsense feeling presentation.The Photos/Gallery app doesn't have something as basic as a slideshow featureNo File Management system other than that of Google Files.The fingerprint reader takes a few tries to recognize and is almost uncomfortably positioned low on the screen that reaching it takes a long thumb or switching grip.Xiaomi has a sunlight mode where even if the phone is set to manual brightness control, it switches to high-visibility mode when blasted with bright sunlight. The ONCE3 has no such choice.No proprietary media player.Themes collection is rather poor and the wallpapers are inadequate too. Even though the app offers many fonts, none of them are suited for a clean looking interface. It's as though their intended target audience is anime watching teenagers.Finally, despite using 60Hz refresh rate, always-on display off and 2G network most of the time with WIFI on all the time, the battery backup is nothing phenomenal for a 5000mAh device. My 4 year old Note 7 Pro with a 4000mAh delivers almost the same kind of SoT with similar configuration.Overall, it's not a bitter disappointment, but I find it quite lack-luster for a 2024 phone in this price-range. If I were to be reasonable, the phone is barely worth 16,000 INR. Take the brand, the display and the charger away, the phone is barely worth 12.

This is my first one plus and brought with lots of expectation . In the box there it comes , Main Device, user manual, welcome letter, Red cable club card, One plus sticker, sim ejector pin, One free TPU same color case with one plus logo at the back and the 80watt charging adapter with red type c cable.  The deisgn of this nord 3 series  is also d√©j√† vu .  However after use of few days , first of all i noticed - - The phone has pure plastic built with glossy polycarbonate glass back . Though it captures no finger print .- Hybrid sim tray with either dual sim or one sim and MSD card- Comes with IR blaster to use this phone as remote.- Top and bottom Dual speaker with dolby atmos sound . Bottom speaker gives you bass effect of the music while top acts like twitter.  Overall sound quality is quite loud and sweet .- Has NFC payment support which is quite attractive part . You can now make wireless payment via Google pay from your credit card virtually . No need to carry card at wallet.- Samsung 6.7inch Amoled display with punch hole camera design and indisplay finger print sensor.- 5000 mah battery with 80 watt superVocc first charge . Battery draining rate is also very less at standard use . Makes full Charge in just 35 minutes.- Snapdragon processor is also capable of goog gaming without any frame drop and lag . The Ram is virtuality expandable upto extra 8GB- During gaming , its large vapor cooling chamber keeps the phone temperature optimal and shows allmost less heating issue. The whole smartphone body has 12 temperature sensor .- It has UFS 3.1 storage capacity . It comes with 23 Gb system equipped storage.***BUT ///- Has very average camera with allmost poor processing . It has flagship sony sensor which has been used in oneplus 11 too  but one plus team was very lazy to make it more optimzed for this device . So always d√©j√† vu dont give you good experience.- Oneplus is known for good camera smartphone but picture quality of this Nord CE 3 looks like the smartphones under 10000 . Colors of the pictures looks like washed out with less detail- night mode pictures does not makes so much of difference than the photos taken in normal mode . Colors, lights and exposures both stay allmost same- video quality is good but can be improved more . It has OIS image stabiliization which works only at 1080p 60 fps- 2x loseless zoom is a good feature .- Selfie camera is quite good  and takes bright picture . Has screen flash option . selfie camera shoots full hd video . Has pano and night mode option too .- being a mid level flagship phone missing Potrait video mode and pro video mode .- Macro camera is quite ok .* This phone strictly uses google dialer, so no more silent call record . And there are no one plus dialer .* Has no out of the box optimization , junk cleaning and antivirus software.* No alert slider* No 3.5mm jackSo i think one plus should give a immediate update to fix the camera optimization issue for this great hardware . Otherwise this is a very good balanced phone for every task . I brought at 24,999 , this is the quite ok price rather than it's MRP.

If you are looking for best multimedia phone in 20k, don't go anywhere else...Do not expect high from processor, it will get you through daily tasks.It is potent enough to survive an hour of gaming.Camera.....it is better....if you compare with moto....oppo Vivo are obviously superior than this...if you are a guy who is not photo crazy and just clicks photos to keep as a memory....you won't be disappointed....Software....if you are coming from moto or stock android.....you are up for huge disappointment....for oppo Vivo guys it's a different experience....samsung guys will hate this UI for sure...Overall thoughtThis phone is made for people in their 40s.GenZ guys can gift this phone to their parents.

Solid battery + performance, average camera, poor build
","
Bought this phone for my wife and she's been using it for 3-4 days now. She has upgraded from the OnePlus 7, where as I use the OnePlus 9Pro.While setting up the phone for her and during basic usage of WhatsApp or Instagram, there's hardly any difference to the naked eye between this Nord 3 CE and other flagships. The display is solid, good colours. The fingerprint and face unlock are super fast. The haptic feedback while typing and navigation is very responsive. Oxygen OS 13 is stable and well optimised. Makes the experience of using this phone very smooth.Battery performance is excellent too. Goes from 10-80% in 25 mins. And a full 100% lasts 30-40 hours depending on usage.Camera is okay. Meant for those who have simple and basic usage. Video - OIS is average.The only thing I didn't like is the back cover. Feels very delicate. It's like a thin silicone-plastic layer, that's it. OnePlus should have used better material for the back to make the phone more sturdy. My mom has an old OnePlus Nord 2 CE Lite. Even that has a more sturdy back cover.Verdict: At 25k with back discount, this phone is phenomenal for the average user (priority is calls with everyday social media usage and browsing on Chrome). Performance, display, battery, OS are all pretty solid.But if you are a content creator who wishes to record high quality videos for making reels or YouTube videos, or your work needs you to continusly have your video on for Zoom meetings, then maybe, this phone is not for you. You'll need to consider investing in a better phone above the 35-40k price range.

But simply closed the request.When he had no authority in the first place for damaged items.Amazon is playing fraud with the customers.

I writing this review after using it for over eight months.Pros: build quality is good. Well expected for this price range. Stock android and no float wares , you just have to turn of some settings.Cons: 1. But there's issue of ads messages. Even if you block some new ones will appear.2. Aa you know the OnePlus phones mother boards are causing issues. And I'm some myself. After the recent updates I have been experiencing issues with the audio. In YouTube or Instagram audio is getting cutoff in mid. Same with some games. Call drops, call audio not clear even in full coverage. 5G speed issues even in green 5G areas.

A great phone with an average camera
","
Been using this for over a month now so I've tested everything and here is my review:What's good:1. Performance: The Snapdragon 782 performs as expected, with no lag doing any normal task, smooth multitasking, and doesn't heat up doing any of it.2. Gaming: I don't play many games, especially the heavy ones, but I tried some and it was able to give decent frame rates on high settings, but occasionally there were some stutters on games. which also reduced when I turned high-performance mode(but that heats the phone more and obviously uses more battery). the phone isn't being marketed as a gaming phone and if you want one there are phones with more gaming-centered features in the price range.3. Display: The display is great, thin, and even bezel all around. with no flickering issues, smooth 120hz (requires high setting, auto select often uses 90hz instead of 120hz). Good colours and personally the max brightness is enough for me, but if you regularly use your phone under strong sunlight you might like a phone with 1300 nits or more, but most phones like nothing phone 1 in this price range have the same max brightness as nord ce 34. Software: No ads or bloatware out of the box is great, Oxygen OS (color os) is fine and has decent features but One UI is better (the full One UI that you get on Samsung phones that cost 30000 or more)5. Connectivity: No issues with 4G or 5G connectivity and speed, wifi calling works but not on airplane mode (for those who want it). Wifi and Bluetooth also work well. The only thing missing is VoNR support, hopefully, it will be added with Android 14.6. haptics: It has great haptics, the vibration on typing and in games is similar to what you see in flagship phones so that is great to see.What's not good:1. Camera: The camera is average in quality.Has all the features you need but overall quality is not up to the mark for a phone that costs this much.The issues are all software-based since it has a good camera sensor, so hopefully it'll get better, but for now, you can try GCam for better results (needs to be downloaded and installed from the internet so be careful)2. Battery: 80W charging is super fast, takes 20-25 minutes to charge the phone from 20-90. But the backup is not very good. I get 6-8 hours of screen-on-time depending on how much 5G I use and what I do. But on my usage I was able to get as much on a phone with 4000mah battery as well.

One plus forever
","
After using the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G for a while, I‚Äôm quite impressed with what it offers at its price point. The 6.72-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate makes the screen incredibly smooth, especially while scrolling and playing games. The colors are vivid, and watching videos or browsing feels quite immersive.The performance is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset, which has been decent for everyday tasks like browsing, using social media, and light gaming. Multitasking is seamless thanks to the 8GB RAM, and the phone handles most apps without lag. However, for more intense gaming or heavy usage, it can show some limitations compared to higher-end models.One of the highlights for me is the 108MP main camera. It captures photos with impressive detail, especially in well-lit conditions. The colors are sharp, and it‚Äôs great for casual photography. Low-light performance, though, could be better, as the images sometimes appear grainy. The 16MP front camera works well for selfies, delivering clear and bright images.Battery life is another strong point. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts me a full day with moderate use, and the 67W SUPERVOOC fast charging is incredibly quick‚ÄîI can get from 0 to 80% in around 30 minutes, which is a lifesaver when I‚Äôm in a hurry.In terms of design, the phone feels sturdy but lightweight, and the matte finish on the back is sleek without being too slippery. The only downside for me is that the phone lacks certain flagship features like water resistance or wireless charging, but at this price, it‚Äôs understandable.Overall, I‚Äôd say the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G offers solid performance, a vibrant display, and excellent battery life for everyday users. It‚Äôs a great value for the price if you're looking for a mid-range 5G phone with reliable features.

Wonderful mobile
","
I am writting this review after using the phone for more than a year. My satisfaction level is quite high for this phone. The built of mobile is so good. Look wise it is quite trendy. Performance is excellent. Quality of camera is very good. It comes with a super chager. Charging time of the mobile is very less. Back up is nice. After all it's a crafted mobile. It's worth every penny you spent .  I have only small issues regarding the sound quality. When connected to bluetooth the sound is very low even at maximum volume.  I specifically want to mention about it's water resistance quality. 'Marvellous' is what I would like to mention about it's resistivity towards ingress of water. My mobile fell down in water and remained under water for nearly 6 hours. When recovered, I was surprised to see the mobile still working nicely. All parameters were fine. Only SIMs were out of order due to water ingress in the SIM slot. I dried it up with a air blower, inserted the SIM and they started working fine. There was no water ingress to any other parts of the mobile. The net connectivity was working fine.  This was a pleasant surprise to me. I have decided to buy only One plus for any future purchase. I highly recommend this. Thank you One Plus.

Overpriced and Underperforming
","
I‚Äôve been using the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite, and honestly, I‚Äôm not satisfied with it, especially considering the price. It feels like you‚Äôre paying an extra ‚Çπ2000 just for the OnePlus brand, when you could get a similar phone from Realme for much less.The camera is quite disappointing, especially for indoor shots, and the video quality in low light is very poor. The processor is underwhelming‚Äîit often feels laggy, especially during multitasking, which is frustrating for a phone in this price range. After just six months, it‚Äôs started taking 3-4 seconds to unlock when I press the power button, which is concerning.To make matters worse, the battery has degraded quickly. Initially, it would last two days, but now I‚Äôm struggling to get through even a single day. Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this phone‚Äîit just doesn‚Äôt offer the performance or quality you‚Äôd expect for the price.

Charges fast with dual 5g support on both sims.Does not drain much battery on using mobile hotspot or connecting multiple devices ‚ù§Ô∏è Selfie camera is awesome in day as well as night. However, for using back camera in low or dim light, you would need to use the pro mode for best snaps. Using the product for more than a year now and there is nothing to complain except the charging speed which has decreased a bit but you would not notice it :)

One plus forever
","
After using the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G for a while, I‚Äôm quite impressed with what it offers at its price point. The 6.72-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate makes the screen incredibly smooth, especially while scrolling and playing games. The colors are vivid, and watching videos or browsing feels quite immersive.The performance is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset, which has been decent for everyday tasks like browsing, using social media, and light gaming. Multitasking is seamless thanks to the 8GB RAM, and the phone handles most apps without lag. However, for more intense gaming or heavy usage, it can show some limitations compared to higher-end models.One of the highlights for me is the 108MP main camera. It captures photos with impressive detail, especially in well-lit conditions. The colors are sharp, and it‚Äôs great for casual photography. Low-light performance, though, could be better, as the images sometimes appear grainy. The 16MP front camera works well for selfies, delivering clear and bright images.Battery life is another strong point. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts me a full day with moderate use, and the 67W SUPERVOOC fast charging is incredibly quick‚ÄîI can get from 0 to 80% in around 30 minutes, which is a lifesaver when I‚Äôm in a hurry.In terms of design, the phone feels sturdy but lightweight, and the matte finish on the back is sleek without being too slippery. The only downside for me is that the phone lacks certain flagship features like water resistance or wireless charging, but at this price, it‚Äôs understandable.Overall, I‚Äôd say the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G offers solid performance, a vibrant display, and excellent battery life for everyday users. It‚Äôs a great value for the price if you're looking for a mid-range 5G phone with reliable features.

Wonderful mobile
","
I am writting this review after using the phone for more than a year. My satisfaction level is quite high for this phone. The built of mobile is so good. Look wise it is quite trendy. Performance is excellent. Quality of camera is very good. It comes with a super chager. Charging time of the mobile is very less. Back up is nice. After all it's a crafted mobile. It's worth every penny you spent .  I have only small issues regarding the sound quality. When connected to bluetooth the sound is very low even at maximum volume.  I specifically want to mention about it's water resistance quality. 'Marvellous' is what I would like to mention about it's resistivity towards ingress of water. My mobile fell down in water and remained under water for nearly 6 hours. When recovered, I was surprised to see the mobile still working nicely. All parameters were fine. Only SIMs were out of order due to water ingress in the SIM slot. I dried it up with a air blower, inserted the SIM and they started working fine. There was no water ingress to any other parts of the mobile. The net connectivity was working fine.  This was a pleasant surprise to me. I have decided to buy only One plus for any future purchase. I highly recommend this. Thank you One Plus.

Overpriced and Underperforming
","
I‚Äôve been using the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite, and honestly, I‚Äôm not satisfied with it, especially considering the price. It feels like you‚Äôre paying an extra ‚Çπ2000 just for the OnePlus brand, when you could get a similar phone from Realme for much less.The camera is quite disappointing, especially for indoor shots, and the video quality in low light is very poor. The processor is underwhelming‚Äîit often feels laggy, especially during multitasking, which is frustrating for a phone in this price range. After just six months, it‚Äôs started taking 3-4 seconds to unlock when I press the power button, which is concerning.To make matters worse, the battery has degraded quickly. Initially, it would last two days, but now I‚Äôm struggling to get through even a single day. Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this phone‚Äîit just doesn‚Äôt offer the performance or quality you‚Äôd expect for the price.

Using the product for more than a year now and there is nothing to complain except the charging speed which has decreased a bit but you would not notice it :)

I had purchased this phone on sept 2023 at 19,999k but now I can see a huge price drop the product, however the the phone is actually a choice and battery is also good no heat issue performs well. Only the drawback is the camera, it's not so good.

Medium usage level phone for daily usage
","
Reviewing after 20days of usage.Good performece won't say this phone is best but okay for normal usage not for gaming or super heavy user purpose. Display is decent thumbs up for it.Camera is mediocre, battery run for whole day, good thing is it super charged with 100W charger from 20-100% in 30minutephone is not heating as other are saying, althought it's normal for smartphone to get heated while charging so it happens with this one.played Pubg fro 4-7hours non stop at HD settings it worked smoothly. Their is high performance mode and 120hz settings so not to worry we can turn it on for heavy usage like gaming but it will consume more battery.Screen is is visible bright in outdoors against sunlight..Phone will take around 20gb of storage for system.my current occupied storage is 44gb with apps out of 128gb.Phone UI is good not best, good thing is their is no bloaware their are some apps which we can disable easily.with 20days of calling, gaming, heavy video watching i m satisfied with the product..no issue for now.Even I dropped mistakenly this one it's fine with the cover nothing bad happened.I m 1st time one plus user very happy, I also bought 1year extended warranty from official one plus website...so I have 2yrs manufacture warranty at extra Rs.599.phone body is plastic nd fits good in big hands, small hand people will face problem holding the device.Final suggestion yes go for it if you are normal usage watching videos, running different apps for various task, calling also decent but speaker is not too loud on call but that's acceptable.Price could have been lower around 18k or 20k something.Bought at 24.5k.. of which 22k is price and 2.5k GST.

I've been using this phone for about a week now and I feel that it's super awesome. Let's talk about the pros and cons :Pros1. The display is pretty bright and amazing. It can play HDR videos upto 1440p in YouTube and you can set your device to brighten up while playing HDR videos in the setting.2. The UI is very smooth. It has a lot of features too!3. The cameras are awesome! They click such amazing photos and shoot amazing videos. It clicks natural photos. There are modes like timelapse,slow-mo,etc too. It has OIS, which only records at 1080p 60fps. There is a mode in the video section named 'ultra steady' by which you can use OIS.4. The performance of the phone is amazing and is well optimised!5. The built is quality is nice too!6. The charging is fabulous! It has a 100 watt charger in the box which can full charge your phone in 25 minutes when smart rapid charging is on. The battery backup is just amazing. This phone gives a whopping 1.5-2 days of battery backup.7. There is a feature that you might not know, you can adjust the intensity of brightness of the torch by pressing and holding the torch symbol, just like iphones.8. The speakers are loud AF! After updating there is this mode where you could ultra boost volume upto 300% which is crazy! And it's very-very loud.Cons1. It can't play 2160p in HDR.2. It doesn't support OIS on 4k 30fps and the OIS video has very slight unnoticeable jitterness.3. The animation is kinda slow but smooth for me, so I changed it in developer options.4. The frame and back is made up of plastic.The phone is pretty awesome and the cons don't bother me üòÑ.I'm a tech enthusiast so you can trust on me!

ProsGood camera , the proxdr mode have better quality imagesSmooth performance and no lag , try to avoid using phone in direct sunlight as it decreases performance.Good battery backup and fast chargingAt first day the battery backup was not good when it was initially charged in the box before.All the pointers are goodBut here comes the main issue which is that tempered glass thing , I have gone to local shop to put tempered glass on it and literally I have try out 8-9 tempered glasses and no one fits it ,and every one of them get bubbles. So make sure you but original tempered.Camera 4.5/5Performance 4.6/5Battery 4.9/5Display 4.8/5

Phone quality is decent. Feels good in hand. It's really light weight and fast. Picture quality from both the front facing and rear facing camera is impressive. It's a new phone so no hanging issue so far. I have charged it once since I started using it on 02/10/2024 so charge lasted almost 48 hours with mild usage. No heating issue faced so far. Thank you Amazon it was nice shopping with you.Note: Been four days. I would definitely recommend this phone. Earlier I was using narzo 50  pro 5g but I would say I am happy with this. Narzo started to hang after one year. Let's see how this works.

Camera not bad, it performs well but don't expect more about camera. And I doesn't notice any lagging issues if you want to you for your daily purpose it is perfect mobile for you but you want to play Games it is not suitable. The best thing is charging It is charged very quickly it doesn't take more than 40 min to charge 100 percent.

The Exchange Scam By Amazon
","
I have no complaint with phone it is Quite Decent Phone but Only lacks in 2nd Camera Functionality the Ultra wide angle camera in below average not expected by OnePlusThe Selfie camera is decent but can me improved.NOW THE EXCHANGE SERVICE SCAMThe delivery service has been terrible. I ordered my phone on October 3rd, and it was supposed to arrive the next day. I even took a leave from work, but it still didn't arrive. This happened for several days, and despite 7-8 complaints, I suffered a loss of 2-3k for missing work.As for the exchange service, my phone had a minor back panel issue and a dented frame, but the delivery guy falsely claimed the display was damaged. He drastically lowered the value of my phone from ‚Çπ5150 to ‚Çπ1700, which is absurd for a phone with 6GB RAM and a decent G95 chipset. After negotiating, I agreed to pay ‚Çπ3450 to get my phone back. The delivery guy asked me to pay the remaining exchange amount on his personal number, which raised my suspicions. I suspect he took my payment and sold my phone at a higher price. I didn't raise an issue since I just wanted my phone as soon as possible because i have a urgent work in Gurgaon.

No qualms with Nord CE 4!!!
","
It is a large smartphone (using iPhone, used GT Master Edition previous Android), use it with two hands.Got a aftermarket tempered glass that perfectly fits on the mobile with no bubbles with stock back cover, (the very first day there was a huge scratch due to my other mobile back cover on the pre-applied scratch guard, also would suggest to apply back side membrane as it is a plastic back and over the time dust accumulated under the back cover caused scratches, spots even on my iPhone that has a glass back.I liked the color and back cover that is transparent. Had no issues with Jio 5G, Bluetooth, WiFi, calling etc.Speakers are powerful to watch TMKOC, Crime Patrol, Shorts, Reels etc.I did face some gitters & hiccups on videos playback on YouTube with 1080p after August Security Patch that i updated on 8/15. Waiting on PlayStore to push an update to resolve this.All in all it is a stable, balanced, reliable and has a better performance.I wished to buy a OnePlus 2 during my college days but Nord CE 4 is my first OnePlus device.

Buy this phone only if you are on a tight budget of around Rs25000.
","
The phone's display is not upto the mark at least when compared with displays of Xiaomi phones with Dolby vision and 1.5k resolution.Cameras capture natural photos in daylight. 50+8 MP rear is ok. 16 mp front is decent too.Battery of 5500 mAh lasts for more than 6 hrs. 100 Watt charger that comes in the box, charges the phone from 0 to 100% in 31 minutes.  If you don't play games and are not a binge watcher, the battery can last longer and you won't have to charge frequently although it charges pretty fast.Storage of ufs 3.1 256 GB is good and because it has a hybrid simcard, we can put a memory card of upto 1 TB along with 1 sim card.Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 doesn't perform its best. The phone has hung a few times in the past and I had to restart the device once. Moderate gaming can be done easily.2160p videos stutter and do not play smoothly on YouTube.3.5 mm Headphone jack is missing.So, the only good thing about this phone is its 100W fast charging feature.Animations aren't smooth.Phone is light weight and easy to hold.You can buy phones like the Redmi Note 13 pro plus or Motorola Edge 50 pro if you can stretch the budget around above Rs 30000.

After a week of usage.
","
Genuine Feedback on this phone after a week of using it.Pro :1. Phone has attractive design and colour.2. Android 14 experience is good.3. Camera is decent, depth pictures are also nornally fine.4. Sound quality is very good. Stereo works well on it.5. 256 GB + SD card option is a good option.6. Battery back up is very nice, in normal usage it went for 2 days straight without charging and took just 25 minutes approx to get full from 10%.Cons :1. Phone's back panel is pure plastic, something on which OnePlus really compromised considering the hefty price of 25999/- for middle user as this clearly gives very annoying experience after taking the phone in hand.2. Again OnePlus straight away compromised on this phone despite of high price is ""Alert Slider"" which is a flagship feature of OnePlus but they managed to take a cornor from it which is really a bad impact on me because I prefer only OnePlus over iPhone being a Android preferring person.3. Since I was a OP5t user and now using 7T (8/256) since Oct 2020, I can clearly experience processor difference in this phone as SD gen 7 system is something which is not as fast as SD 855+ which I m using and still my 7T is king over all these phones.4. While being connected to wifi, the normal calling is interrupting because of not clear voice going to the receiver. Had to switch off wifi and call again. (3 times experienced)5. Weight is little bit high of this phone (my 7T with cover Is lighter them this phone alone)6. Though bought it for the same price but after using it, I think the phone's price is high. The highest price should be anywhere between 20k to 22k.Verdict :Since in Android zone, I have only used OnePlus brand after switching from IOS in 2015 so not sure about other brands. But if you're keen to speed and perfection, try OnePlus other phones or else if you're a middle user then go for.Thanks

I switched from Samsung to One plus for first time and now I don't regret my decision.In this price range it is a good mobile with very good speed I mean the processor.There's no heating issue as mentioned in some of the comments.Camera is good not excellent, however that wasn't my first priority so I am ok with it.What was surprising is you get screen guard as well as back cover and a fast 100volt charger included and the best part is fast charging, I love this feature....although it drains comparatively faster but charging is very very fast.Miss some of Samsung userinterface features but I am not a tech person ...yet to discover One plus interface.Appearance - It's charmingTo summarise - Go for it without hesitation.

I bought this one during summer sell offer. Here is my review after 3 days of usages.I am a casual user.After 1week review changed. This is my fast and last Nord.1. Earlier I was a poco f1 user, I don't like Nord CE4 display size. Not sure why these smartphone companies stopped producing new compact phone.2. It is heavier than poco f13. App cloner doesn't work on this phone4. Video recording quality below average5. Poco f1 has 4k 60FPS option, but CE4 has max 4k 30FPS6. Phone build quality below average. It doesn't feel premium7. Charge drains quickly. But it's still negligible8. It heats up during charging9. Heats up with 3to 5 minutes Torch on10. No LED notification lights11. Boot up time is more. It takes approx 25 sec12. Immediately unlocking phone after reboot using pattern takes time to work smoothly13. Camera app slow response while taking pics one after another within short span14. Back case which comes inside box, that turns into yellow within 2 weeks.I feel a downgrade with this phone...Good part of this phone.Charges 100% just in 35 mins.Display & Sound Clarity is great.Good to watch movies & songs.Camera clarity is ok ok.IR remote works which was missing in poco f1Update - Camera/flash doesn't work when phone temperature is high. Camera/Flash doesn't work in hot summer days (Bhubaneswar temp. Around 40degree c) . Camera app won't launch when phone having less charges.I am not telling that people should not buy this phone. It is not VFM for me. You may not feel same..Request to people don't waste your money on this brand.  So called cheap UI and camera. worst mobile of 2024

Good but software have bugs
","
The phone is good, having good processor, bright display etc etc. People are complaining about heating and battery drain issues, I didn't face any of those. But the phone does have software bugs like sometime the gesture for tourch doesn't work, you have to turn on and off to make it work again. Notification sometime appears over other applications from top but sometime doesn't, even tho it isn't silent, while taking pic from back camera the things those are not in focus get excessive blur ( like I want to take a picture of document, if I focus on center then text at bottom becomes blur) you have to adjust, I understand what's happening but other phones don't do that and also other bugs like these. I hope they fix it. Untill then it's 4/5. If they fix those bugs then it is 4.5/5.Also the back is good and overall design is good too but it doesn't give that premium feel(opinion may vary person to person)

This is my review after 2 months of usage:This is my first Oneplus phone. Besides, a few minor OS instability issues, I dont have much bad to write. This is solid 3.9/5 smartphone.Camera 3.5/5 The camera is not that great. Low light & wide angle images are way too blurry if you zoom into images. I think with future updates they can fix camera.OS 3.7/5 Its Oxygen OS. What can you say, you get stock Android experience with minimal bloatware.Battery 5/5 5500 mah easily lasted me 2 whole days with 4 hrs SOT, the stand by backup this gives is insane. And you usually get 7-8 screen on time.Gaming 3.9/5 This is not a hardcore gaming phone.Display 4.5/5 120hz feels like buttery smooth scrolling. Although the phone has less visibility in direct noon sunlight.Thermals 3.2/5 The phone feels warm to touch on normal continuous scrolling for 45 mins. You cannot use the phone under direct sunlight becoz it gets way too hot.

I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won‚Äôt run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.

My review :Performance [ 4/5 ] - Gaming Performance good but you'll see some frame drops and lag somewhere while using but a great gaming experience at this price.Camera [ 3/5 ] - Very limit features in camera app and quality is also not good and you'll find better options in market at 20k.Battery [ 5/5 ] - Awesome battery life and 80w fast charging is crazy and will take about 40m-60m for 0-100%.Display [ 4.5/5 ] - Good display quality in this price segment.Software [ 4/5 ] - Somewhere a decent ui experience but if you are looking for a good ui then Samsung ofc will be the best option.Conclusion - If you are looking for a phone for normal use and don't use camera that much then it's a great choice but OnePlus as a company is not offering you something special  if you buy at by seeing their brand value and it's quite similar to Realme Mobiles.

Visually striking but with poor GPU performance
","
Never buy a phone with Snapdragon 695 if you like to consume 4K video content.The processor of the Nord CE4 Lite 5G phone doesn't support 4 K video playback or recording and doesn't even support 4 K HDR on YouTube.I tried to play MAD MAX FURY ROAD (4K) using a VLC media player, and the video started lagging several times. The same video I played smoothly on my other phone, XIAOMI 11 LITE NE 5G. No issue at all.If you can ignore these cons, the phone is GREAT in terms of battery backup, visual appearance due to its AMOLED screen, refresh rate that you can change at will, and butter-like smoothness in navigating and using apps. Regarding bloatware, yes, they were aplenty but they are easily removable.Camera quality is also good if not very satisfactory considering the price. Since I am not a gamer, so, I can't tell you about gaming performance but based on its inbuilt processor's capabilities, I guess it can pretty much handle less GPU-intensive games like Call of Duty.About charging performance, let me tell you that at the time of switching on the phone and installing a few updates, the battery was around 50%. So, I charged it with its given charger, and within 16 minutes, the battery was fully charged. Therefore, I feel that the slow charging claim of this phone is theoretical and misleading.Beware that there has been huge marketing about the Nord CE 4 Lite 5G phone, calling it an excellent performer. Excellence depends on the user experience, not speculation.I am convinced that if you ignore the phone's processor, the rest of its features are good if you buy it under Rs15000. That's the only justifiable price I set for this phone based on my experience.

Does the job
","
I bought this phone for my mother. It does the job. Display is good, camera is average to good but most importantly the design and looks of this phone is amazing. Camera is not very important for my mother as she rarely clicks pictures and if she will then the camera is good enough. Why I bought this phone over others is simply because it‚Äôs a one plus so brand value is much better than realme, oppo, vivo and others in the segment plus they have provided pre-applied screen guard, 80 watt adapter which alone would cost RS2500 and free oneplus Z2 bullet wireless earphones. All in all I believe it‚Äôs a good package and best for my mother‚Äôs regular usage. People looking for heavy gaming, top notch camera quality, and heavy usage should look elsewhere. Be willing to spend at least 40-50k. Samsung S23 or iphone 15 even iphone 13-14 will be good. I am an iphone 15 pro max user and can say all of the above with confidence.

Pros: Display is good, cellular connectivity is excellent, battery back is excellent and OS is clean and light.Cons: Cost is higher, Processer is very slow so it a challenge to even do day to day task.I would not recommend this to any.

I not like this one plus phone in past my friends discuss about this so I was purchased. if options to change or return then I will sure return it, because after purchase we not get realistic performance from camera to battery and operation as they mentioned in pictures of selling. So I would not suggest to buy.  Can try another brand in same range price I hope that should much Better from this.

","
I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite 5G and, while the phone performs well in terms of general usage, I am very disappointed with the camera quality. OnePlus is often known for delivering great camera performance, so I had higher expectations. Unfortunately, the images lack sharpness, and the overall quality is far below what I had hoped for in this price range.If you‚Äôre someone who values camera performance in your phone, I would not recommend this model. On other fronts, the phone works well, but it falls short if photography is a priority for you.

To be honest, I was a bit skeptical in buying this product after seeing the mixed opinions on Amazon. However, I decided to place an order after watching few videos from reliable YouTubers. I was using a high end phone from Honor for the last 4 years and I decided to opt in for an affordable phone after the battery gave up on my earlier device.I must tell you that this is an amazing phone at this price point. You can throw any app and this device will handle it beautifully. I am not a gamer but tried playing few heavy games just to check if there's any lag or so and did not encounter any issues. Multitasking is breezy thanks to the RAM management. The biggest highlight is the amazing battery backup which goes on and on and on.. I would definitely recommend this phone to people who would be using the device for their day to day tasks. If you are looking at extensive gaming, you might want to check other reviews as I wouldn't be the right person to comment on the same.Please do not go by the negative reviews posted here as many people expect too many things from a budget phone. If you want a good phone that can handle all your basic requirements at an affordable price tag, I would highly recommend you this phone. Please ensure that you invest few hundreds on a good quality tempered glass and back cover as these things are not provided in the box. I hope this review would help few people in making a purchase decision.

Camera quality of this phone is very nice you just need to set picture quality to highest.Speed is good but charging is a bit slow. Sound quality is also top notch I'd recommend to use it on 90hz, 60 hz is also good but 90 has great touch sensitivity.

","
It sits right in the budget, Affordable and value for money. Few set backs for me are : No Physical Gyroscope, Bulky, There's a small bezel, Solid Body. Supports 18W but gives out a 10W Adapter. For a newer model this has 4G and not 5G. A Very good performance for its price range. Appearance is great too, Just little bit feels bulky in hand. Nonetheless, a great purchase.

Budget Beast!!!
","
To be honest, I was a bit skeptical in buying this product after seeing the mixed opinions on Amazon. However, I decided to place an order after watching few videos from reliable YouTubers. I was using a high end phone from Honor for the last 4 years and I decided to opt in for an affordable phone after the battery gave up on my earlier device.I must tell you that this is an amazing phone at this price point. You can throw any app and this device will handle it beautifully. I am not a gamer but tried playing few heavy games just to check if there's any lag or so and did not encounter any issues. Multitasking is breezy thanks to the RAM management. The biggest highlight is the amazing battery backup which goes on and on and on.. I would definitely recommend this phone to people who would be using the device for their day to day tasks. If you are looking at extensive gaming, you might want to check other reviews as I wouldn't be the right person to comment on the same.Please do not go by the negative reviews posted here as many people expect too many things from a budget phone. If you want a good phone that can handle all your basic requirements at an affordable price tag, I would highly recommend you this phone. Please ensure that you invest few hundreds on a good quality tempered glass and back cover as these things are not provided in the box. I hope this review would help few people in making a purchase decision.

It sits right in the budget, Affordable and value for money. Few set backs for me are : No Physical Gyroscope, Bulky, There's a small bezel, Solid Body. Supports 18W but gives out a 10W Adapter. For a newer model this has 4G and not 5G. A Very good performance for its price range. Appearance is great too, Just little bit feels bulky in hand. Nonetheless, a great purchase.

Budget Beast!!!
","
To be honest, I was a bit skeptical in buying this product after seeing the mixed opinions on Amazon. However, I decided to place an order after watching few videos from reliable YouTubers. I was using a high end phone from Honor for the last 4 years and I decided to opt in for an affordable phone after the battery gave up on my earlier device.I must tell you that this is an amazing phone at this price point. You can throw any app and this device will handle it beautifully. I am not a gamer but tried playing few heavy games just to check if there's any lag or so and did not encounter any issues. Multitasking is breezy thanks to the RAM management. The biggest highlight is the amazing battery backup which goes on and on and on.. I would definitely recommend this phone to people who would be using the device for their day to day tasks. If you are looking at extensive gaming, you might want to check other reviews as I wouldn't be the right person to comment on the same.Please do not go by the negative reviews posted here as many people expect too many things from a budget phone. If you want a good phone that can handle all your basic requirements at an affordable price tag, I would highly recommend you this phone. Please ensure that you invest few hundreds on a good quality tempered glass and back cover as these things are not provided in the box. I hope this review would help few people in making a purchase decision.

Camera quality of this phone is very nice you just need to set picture quality to highest.Speed is good but charging is a bit slow. Sound quality is also top notch I'd recommend to use it on 90hz, 60 hz is also good but 90 has great touch sensitivity.

Pros:Affordable priceLarge and vibrant displayLong battery lifeDecent camera performance for the priceExpandable storageCons:Average low-light camera performanceOccasional lag with heavy appsBloatware in MIUIOverall Rating:4.2/5The POCO C65 is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers great value for its price. It has a large and vibrant display, solid battery life, and decent performance for everyday tasks.

It sits right in the budget, Affordable and value for money. Few set backs for me are : No Physical Gyroscope, Bulky, There's a small bezel, Solid Body. Supports 18W but gives out a 10W Adapter. For a newer model this has 4G and not 5G. A Very good performance for its price range. Appearance is great too, Just little bit feels bulky in hand. Nonetheless, a great purchase.

No secondary mic for noise cancelation3. Lower brightness, specially under sunlight4. Charging time is huge due to 10W adaptor very slow charging5. Issue in Hotspot connect6. Single speaker so low sound during calls7. Soft vibration8. Camera quality is very average9. Secong camera seems to be depth sensor and not having any other function while photo or video shoot10.

Overall its a decent device, my only issue is it lacks a gyrometer sensor which is essential in may online games and without it many can't perform in their full potential....its a bit odd to see that my old phone from 4 years ago had a gyrometer sensor and this latest device lacks it.....a bit disappointing to be honest

","
I don't play games on this phone. Review is done using this phone. With daily 7-8 hour use on frequent WhatsApp, YouTube , voice call and messaging and light internet browsing, the battery lasts for 2 days. Internet smooth with 5G support. Do note that the android version used here is the poco version - so it's not as customizable as the standard android. Charging with the 67 charger provided takes around 1 hr or less from 10% to full. Also comes with the key to remove sim card holder. Very good phone for someone who only requires Light usage for daily practicalities

Front cam is 5MP & is pathetic. Don't buy if you are a selfie freak. Back cam is 50MP but images are blurred even with slightest of motion, else ok. 8GB Ram & 256GB space is good. It supports 5G, which is not something too big to cheer for, 4G & 5G speed not much difference. Overall, don't expect too much from this phone because this is meant for strict budget guys. Charger provided is 10W, even though it supports 18W. Battery will last a day for sure. Sound quality during call is poor.

Impressive design and economical pricing
","
Poco M6 Pro 5G (8GB/256GB) is an impressively cost effective phone using an Octacore 2.2 GHz Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 processor. Usage journey is summarised below for other users to optimise it for higher performance, battery efficiency & nil bloatware experience.Its a clear equivalent of Redmi 12 5G except NFC.  I saw many users write about it having ads and bloatware, issues with battery drain, etc.  These issues can be resolved to a great extent as I did.As soon as it was put on the network, it downloaded Xiaomi HyperOS1.0.1.0 UMWINXM, ANDROID 14.  The update was 4.4GB, took some time but the OS is as smooth as MIUI 14/ Android 13.Battery drain can be simply reduced by using the Battery saver mode.  Further, you require to fine tune on background apps and disable ads, remove recommendations to reduce irritation.  Camera is decent.  Processor performance is good, no lagging.  However, the famous quickball has been removed.  For those interested to still want it on the device, the apk has to be installed additionally. For me, I like that wonderful feature as it was a life saver in older Poco/ Redmi/ Mi phones when the Menu/ Home/ Back navigation panel failed.  With Quickball, my Redmi 3s is still working perfectly since last 7.5+ years.  So, I did load the quickball version 15.0.1.0.1 and being tested.POCO phones are always the beta for 'go to market' followed by the equivalent redmi versions.  I have been using POCO (F1, C3, M3) user for many years, are truely worth the money, good hardware.Many came with a 6000mAh battery but this one has 5000mAh battery.  The charger is fast (22.5W) but I prefer to slow charge the battery at night with a 5V/ 0.7A or 1A charger to improve the battery life, reduce the risk of battery bulging. It also reduces the risk of load on charger circuit due to lower charging current and no heat-up (Li-ion does not like heat, hence slow charging is safest), so battery and peripheral components remains safe and long lasting. The box came with its own transparent back-cover but I preferred a thicker back cover.Has a single Loudspeaker, hence lower audio volume.  But the Screen is bright, even 30% is good for normal use.The most important feature of Xiaomi is the backup and restore, making the new phone have the exact look of your old Xiaomi phone in less than 5 minutes, some apps may not get backed-up.Finally, Amazon delivery was on time.  Its just 4 days of testing and as of know I am satisfied.Update after a week of use- Though the download speed is good, the phone does not show 5G (JIO SIM) on its display (it shows 4G+). This is an important part to resolve, probably a patch may be necessary if at all this is a bug, since the service provider detects it as a 5G phone but the phone itself shows 4G+.  Requesting Xiaomi to validate my finding and close this accordingly.When the same SIM is put in another phone (Samsung/ IPhone), it shows 5G clearly. So this is an issue to be resolved by XIAOMI to prove that it is genuinely a 5G phone.No heating issue noticed after a week of use now.UPDATE 2:We can force the network setting to 5G through developer options as 'NR' in Set preferred network type.  But the battery drains drastically, hence avoid that.  So the phone is obviously 5G when network setting is forced.  Obviously all may not want to touch developer mode, so best to leave it as 5G/LTE in normal network settings.  If XIAOMI patches to augment the setting as NR only in addition to common settings, it can show up 5G on the display, but at the cost of high battery consumption.UPDATE 3 (16 April 2024):The legendary Xiaomi Quickball (apk version 15.0.1.0.1) has been tested and found to be working satisfactorily.  Post hardening of HyperOS, the phone is almost AD free.  Google loaded its own 'Messages' apk which will take control of the inbuilt  default 'Messaging' app  I have kept the Messaging app as default for messages as I dont want to use messages app of google for privacy control.  Battery being 5000mAH, is found to be lasting for 2 days with mobile data 'ON'.  A 6000mAH battery would have been better as found on many earlier POCO phones.  Quality of hardware is very good and performing.  With the new HyperOS 1.0.2.0 loaded, 2 years of formal updates makes it a an economical phone with good features.  Reminding all that ads-free performance can only be achieved after hardening through developer mode.  I havent used memory boost function, I dont think I will require it with a 8GB (uses LPDDR5) memory.  Only if needed, I will configure it.  I have also installed a 128 GB memory card, which virtually reduces internal memory usage.UPDATE 4 (18 April 2024):A bug is identified on HyperOS.  When Wifi calling is ON and Wifi is connected with a stable network, outgoing calls cannot be made.  Incoming calls also do not get through.  I have tested this multiple times.  Xiaomi has to immediately act and fix this bug.  Upon putting WiFi calling OFF, the phone resumes normally.  This problem did not exist on earlier MIUI used by me.Except this new bug identified and therefore stopping Wifi calling (actually stopping wifi calling has improved the battery life, so I dont mind not having this feature as JIO network does not have issues in our area and around), POCO M6 Pro 5G is a decent value for money.  Most positives, smaller negatives for a phone in 11-12k range.  Surely, Xiaomi should action it with a patch immediately.UPDATE 5.. Only for MIUI phone users, wont work for other phones (18 May 2024):When POCO M6 Pro is fully configured, take its backup using Additional Settings--> Backup and restore.  A backup file is generated in MIUI folder under AllBackup--> Backups--> Filename with backup date.  Simply copy that file and move it to your old Mi/ Redmi/ POCO phone (min. Android 10) in exacly the same folder.  Then restore that file.  While it will replicate the phone, you will get the benefit of the new look Control Centre.  The old MIUI Control Centre will be replaced by the new HyperOS Control Centre with no change to Android Version or security patch.  I liked this look and have retained the new HyperOS Control Center in my old POCO C3, which is a backup of the new phone (in case of exercising Disaster Recovery option). Its like the old Car in a new shell.  Havent had any issue on that since last 15 days of using the HyperOS Control Centre in the old POCO C3.  Others can enjoy too.UPDATE 6.. For 6 GB/ 128 GB Version (31 July 2024):I have also bought the 6 GB/ 128 GB variant.  Having hardened the HyperOS, this phone is almost a stock android like with nil bloatware.  The usage time has increased since the memory utilisation has reduced and with it, the battery lasts slightly longer as compared to the 8 GB/ 256 GB variant.  You would notice that Xiaomi has released the Poco M6 plus and Redmi 13 5g variant last month using the same processor by little overclocking (they call it accelarated or AE) to 2.3 GHz instead of 2.2 GHz,  adding a 120 Hz display and 108 MP camera, etc with 35% higher price for 6GB/ 128GB.  Well, I am contented with the M6Pro 5g's price to performance since frying the CPU may reduce its life.Regards..... AD

I purchased it for my mum, the product is classy as I purchased the grey coloured one.Battery backup, stability all are good!Fingerprint sensor all works fine!According to the price it is a value for money!One thing you must consider while buying poco is that later on after 2.5yrs of age, the devices gets system issues,My personal phone is poco m3 now it's 3 yrs old, sometimes when I use it intensly till charge gets zero, the devices didn't charge when plugged, it takes charge after 12-15 hrs untill the CPU gets cool.So my advice never use poco mobiles untill zero % battery charge!Another drawback is that poco cameras , unlike Vivo, poco cameras are good in initial days (for the 1st yr) later it is worse! My poco m3 camera(48MP) is very bad to take photos now after 3 yrs. But my old Vivo(13MP) 7yr old phone still captures better photos.

Processoris good at this price range, BGMI performance is decent with medium setting.Displayis bigger but I'm disappointed with its brightness. Company claims 1300 nits but I don't think it is more than 800 nits.BatteryIs very average, 30 mins of gaming and nearly 15% battery drops. The company claims it to be 5000 mah, but I'm sure it is not more than 4000 mah. It drops very quickly.Chargingis pretty good and faster. 30 mins of charging gives 30% battery life. But due to very low battery quality, you might need to charge it twice a day.The phone is lighter than majority of phones, and look wise it is more attractive.CameraIs the best part I liked the most. Any other phones don't have such camera quality at this price segment.Ram Rom performance is v.good and storage of 128gb is enough. With 6 gb Ram. This phone is ditto copy of Redmi 12, but that is at ‚Çπ12500, only difference is the branding. I suggest you to buy this one Poco m6 pro, which is way cheaper.Sound Quality is decent at this price. Rest all the features performs really well and I bought this at a discount @ ‚Çπ9999.I'm happy with this product for the price I paid.If you can afford ‚Çπ3000 than this range, then definitely go for some other options, because poco has boasted this product a lot. It is 20%  less than what is claims.

I have played many games like bgmi, freefire and many other games, only frame drop problem is there2.

I don't have any heating related issues on this phone, it's good!!4. Even the phone is with 22.5 watt fast charger but still it takes 2-2.5 hours to charge fully, so it's not fast charging5. Overall you should consider this phone if you want to do gaming, only fps drop issue is thereThis phone is good in performance wise you should buy it...It's value for money

I have been using almost a week.Pro's: heating issues without gaming.Battery drains too fast.Display image is not upto the mark compare to price range.  it is same as a  tecno spark 9 which cost only Rs 8500 back 2022 Whereas this phone is Rs 13000 in Amazon.Cons :  phone design is  sexy and decent looksI like the looks of glass type back cover.Sound quality also awesome.Overall not value for money at 3K range.

Overall the product is good and performs very well. The camera is below decent. speaker is loud which is good sign. It's ok to purchase if you are a normal user and won't watch much movies and tv shows. The display it full HD+ IPS LCD which quite good but not for entertainment lovers. They need to go for Amoled or Poled displays.

Amazon packing was very bad and if talk about mobile phone so because of its price phone is ok ok not so good , display is like kaam chl jayega but not very good, not so colorful I know it's an ips display but still my redmi note 7 pro (5 uear old ,14k price) which also has an ips pannel is way more colourfull and feels more brighter, speaker not louder same like kaam chlaau at this price point. Baki battery 3 ghnte charge hone m leti h and it doesn't feel like k ye 5000 mah ki battery h aisa lgta h ki 4000 ya 4500 mah ki ho , cameras b kuch khass nhi h.Baki performance shi h,Software experience accha h,And build quality b shi h,Overall, agr budget 2-4 hjaar bdha loge to boht kuch accha mil jayega wrna agr kaam chlana h ya budget ki problem h bss to fir poco m6 pro 5g shi h kaam chl jayega.

I would like to say about the battery that it is little bad or we can say it drains fast from any other phones, I guess it is 4500 mah but the other things the good. It just been 4 days of using this phone but I felt really okay with this comfortable price, not much good but not bad as per it's rate. Moreover I did not like it when the delivery boy came I asked him to open and check first but he refused and said it's not available in Amazon its only available in flipcart but the main thing is I got a message in morning that to check the phone before making the phone completely delivered but the delivery boy refused to do that, he directly replied if anything is wrong just return it to Amazon later on.That's all, Thank you.

Good for social media and low graphic games.Only Single speaker & not even much loud.Good software & UI only if you know how to disable/uninstall system apps & notifications.It's POCO so don't know when battery suddenly blast.

Weak mono speaker
","
I am writing this review after using phone 1 monthOppo M6 Pro has a mono speaker and the quality of that speaker is very bad.In some videos you got audible sound but in some videos you need headphone to hear the audio.I used YouTube most and second is Netflix.In both platform I got audio problem.Single mono speaker is not loud enough.I am solving this problem by using headphone.Second problem is hanging issue.When battery reaches at 5% you can't use mobile due to hanging issue.Battery backup is goodDisplay is okay at this prize point.Take one and half hour to charge with 22.5 wat charger.Network aggregation is also nice.Camera quality is decent at 10k.But the single weak Mona speaker is the biggest drawback of this phone. So please avoid.

It's so comfortable to hold it feels very light. The haptics are great(needs a little adjustment).Cameras: 7/10 Not very great but totally usable. There are better options available for cameras at this price.Display: 10/10 It's very immersive due to the thin bezels it looks so good.Performance: 8/10 There are ocassional lags and stutturs if pushed heavy and it even heats up a little but for daily usage it's totally great. Gaming is not that bad either Bgmi played at around 55fps for most of the time.Battery: 9/10 Solid battery.  Charges pretty fast.Connectivity: 7/10 Missing NFC I thought it had nfc and no vonr out of the box.Software: 7/10 Not very pleasant, lacks optimization. YouTube scrolls at 60hz. Overall good though has all the basic stuff. Good animations no major bugs.Overall good phone üëç

If you are purchasing this phone under 17k then this review is for you only.This is a honest review so it's not sponsored, using it from the last 3 days.‚Ä¢Display-u will love the display if you use it , because the display they provide is close to a premium level smartphone under 35k, it's amoled screen is very colour accurate that definitely u will love this under this segment, may be your eye will pain if  you have taken jump from lcd to amoled.YouTube high quality -2160/60fps without any frame drop and lags.‚Ä¢Fingerprint-the sensor is also very good under the segment, you can tell it average like side fingerprint.‚Ä¢Buttons and haptics-the buttons are like under 25k experience and the haptics too, and it also give you to choose the vibration level for haptics.‚Ä¢Backtap-it is a software update feature and also useful but u can't rely on it because as it's a software update this feature works very minimal like 6/10.‚Ä¢Camera-as the photos u can see the photos are very good and nice details when the object is near to camera , there is photo u can see, that photo is taken from a 16mtr of distance with 10x zoom(you can see that no. Is clearly visible.In terms of recording 1080/60 fps it's stabilization is also very good according to all the phone under 17k.‚Ä¢Performance-for ff the graphics u can play smoothly is ultra without high res, and for bgmi you can last upto hdr 40fps, but I suggest to play in smooth 60fps , there the gyro will be very smooth to play please note that before Playing,On the performance mode and don't run any background apps, the first time u play the camera will be con but time to time it will be habitual.‚Ä¢Sound-sound is very good ,loud nd clear when u turn on the Dolby Atmos.‚Ä¢Battery-the battery may be disappoint u because as it is a 1.5k amoled display, the usage time will be something 5 hour and 10-20 minutes from 100-0% and the speed is very impressive within 40-50 minutes the phone get full charged, and incase u want more speed there's a option to increase the speed of charging but the phone will heat a little bit, after fully charged make sure to off the feature.‚Ä¢Connectivity-when u first insert the sim u will not be able to call and the volte will also not show after updating it to hyper os the option will be appear and u will able to call.The 5g is also very good if u have the range in ookla it will show u 300mbps but when u download something in Play Store the max I get is 40mbps it may be vary, and the bgmi got downloaded within 1:30mins.‚Ä¢Refresh rate-make sure to use 120hz for smooth experience and also on the battery saver so the battery usage got extend.This phone meets all my expectations with all Beauty as it have , if ur purchasing it under 17k go for it , narzo also providing better specs but the display is not that attractive as it is,if u need day to day usage not hardcore gaming and photography go for it. You will not regret it after purchasing it.

Just ok product. Not expect much
","
This review is after 3 days of use. I got this product at a price of 14800 . I expected a lot from this device. Actually i saw so many reviews about this phone. Almost every review says that the problem about camera and battery performance. Actually i also faced these two problems. Battery draining too fast. For my use (no games,only social media and whatsapp) its not lasts for one day. . Also camera performance is even poor. No detailing. Especially at low light conditions its worst.. selfie camera is also same. Before i used redmi note 8 pro. Actually the camera performance of that device is far better than this device.. yah i think this is the compromising parts for this price..Next come to display.. its brilliant.. awesome dsilpay.. bessel less display. Fantastic. . Also the design is not up to the mark. I  purchased black color, fingerprint sumduges are on back. Performance wise, not that much lag, no over heating for normal use. But its little warm . And its ok i think. . Charging is good. Little bit of heating feels when charging. So don't use phone while charging. ..In my opinion, if you can compromise on average battery performance and a just below average camera then its ok.. if you are looking for an all-round phone try something else.. Remember, no phone is comes with a perfect and satisfying performance at these budget prices üôÇ

The performance is very good, it can emulate Pok√©mon X with very minimal stutters and CODM runs quite well too judging by the few games that I‚Äôve played. It‚Äôs not very heavy so it‚Äôs not too unwieldy but it‚Äôs size does cause issues as it‚Äôs too large to use one handed, it‚Äôll take some time to get used to since my last phone was a tiny iPhone 6.I don‚Äôt particularly care about photo quality so I don‚Äôt have much to say but I think the camera is quite good, definitely good enough for stuff like sending homework to friends and whatnot.The phone on Miui 14 did not heat up a lot while emulating Pokemon X but after upgrading to HyperOS it has started heating up enough to make my hands a little sweaty after an hour of playing and I‚Äôve also noticed more stutters and fps drops, not just in game but also in daily tasks like accessing the Notification Centre and the widgets area. So wouldn‚Äôt recommend upgrading to HyperOS rn as it seems to be poorly optimised, this is why I‚Äôm removing a star from the review.The battery life is good enough to not cause any issues in day to day use, the fast charging is quite, well, fast, it can charge up from 20 to 100 in less than an hour. The headphone jack is quite convenient to have since I don‚Äôt have to use a dongle to connect my headphones to the phone but it‚Äôs placement is rather annoying as it causes the upper part of the phone to become a little heavier.The phone did arrive with a LOT of bloatware tho, I‚Äôd recommend removing everything unnecessary using a software called Universal Android Debloater which is available on GitHub, but only do this after researching what is safe is remove and what isn‚Äôt as it‚Äôs easy to brick the phone by carelessly removing apps using UAD.TLDR : It‚Äôs a good phone in terms of emulation performance and battery life, on Miui 14 I did not notice any major performance issues or excessive heating but in HyperOS that changed and performance has decreased a little and the phone has started heating up faster.

Respect Consumer's money
","
I am a regular buyer of Xiaomi brand since Mi3 launch in India.Myself using and suggesting everyone to buy mi mobiles.Mi itself giving value for money products and poco giving some more value.Recent times they removed stereo speakers then charging speeds reduced to 18w from 33w which is deal breaker to me.Anyway they offered a complete package in the recent times with Poco X6.I ordered two sets and updated to Hyper OS.Hardware wise display is a gem for the price.But they removed online HDR playback capabilities which in senseless. 1.5k resolution, 67billion colors but no HDR? What?Cameras are fine in day light. Theya are justified the price.Battery also fine, I could understand the 120 refresh rate and 1.5k consumption is high so no issues.Build l, Stereo speakers, Headphone jack out, charging speeds all good.So they should bring back HDR capabilities otherwise... they already know about the market and competitors.

good hardware specifications , but software full of bloatware
","
This phone has very good hw specifications for its price . but the provided charger is 67W which over heats phone to uncomfortable level to even hold it .  there is no option to disable fast charging on this phone . so I had to purchase a 20W charger to charge this phone without it getting overheated . another problem is that this phone is full of bloatware and personalization services and adds buried in every app . buy a moto g55 or g45 to get stock android  for same price .  given second choice i would have got a moto for same price  even though it has lcd and a slightly weaker processor . I wish poco gives a normal charger for budget phones , with poco phones exploding in internet i don't know why they give such high wattage overheating charger with this phone . overall good hardware, smooth software , full of bloatware  .

","
To cut it short  -1) It has been the most value for money mobile in around 18k (after discount) .2) Remember - turn on fast charging from setting otherwise your mobile will take 33w only not 67 , i didnt knew at first and thought it is charging slow lol.3) On heavy  normal usage ( i dont do gaming) it lasts around 7 hrs on performance mode.4) Display is mind blowing ( no hdr but whos gonna play it anyway)5) i dont care about camera that much but it take fine images.6) Strictly not for heavy gamers.7) Hyperos is actually better and smoother.8) turn to normal mode from performance mode if you face heating issues.Verdict - for a regular user who takes calls, uses social media watch movies it is perfect phone.**I will update after  3 months usage

Great value, especially considering the price of ‚Çπ15k during sale. It‚Äôs slim and light weight and the 1.5k resolution display is the main highlight. However the camera quality is quite poor, colours are very dull and details are absent. I have used similarly prices phones such as iqoo neo 6 and iqoo z7 before this and they offer a far superior camera experience.P.S. beware of the skyline blue colour shown in the brand pictures. In reality it‚Äôs a bright sky blue colour and may not be to everyone‚Äôs liking.

I have been using various mobiles from apple 14 plus to samsung s22 ultra, I needed a spare phone which can perform well so I decided to go with Poco X6, my reviews for the sameProsExcellent battery backup, though fast charger takes 40 -50 mins to charge fully.The phone is very smooth to use, and i haven't had any heating issue.The 5g connectivity and wifi connectivity is solid and no drop till now (using airtel and jio sim)The performance works very fast for your basic usage.Camera is just above average, the main 64MP is good at daylight.ConsCamera could have been better, there is a night mode but yet no justification done, it's okay for the price range but that could have helped to get an edge over the competitors.Not for gamers, though it can handle games, we can clearly see a throttle and lag while playing higher end graphical games.Phones comes with MIUI interface but can be updated immediately to Hyper OS.It has only IP54 rating, so keep it carefully from hard water splashes.Final verdict : An excellent choice at this price range comapred to Vivo and Oppo for office use, networking and daily use.Will update after a months usage.

Pros: budget friendly best performing device, slim nd sleak design with premium plastic back, punchy (colourful) & bright display, camera is best performing in daylight and outdoors and average in indoor and night and telemacro lens was useless, dual app support was fine, good network connectivity (Jio), good rigid back case.Cons: *no expandable memory slot*Performing of camera in night was poorSlow charging: it takes 40-50 minutes to full charge, which is okay for 67-watt charge. But (If we use the handset while charging) it can take 1.5 - 2 hours for full charge. according to accubattery it can charge upto speed of  33watts as peak and mostly 480 Mah/hr speed (measured while using the handset)Battery Drain: mobile can withstand upto 12-24hrs fr regular use and 4-5 hrs fr heavy use such as gaming and noted no heating issue (only warmness noted while gaming & charging the handset)

I purchase poco X6 on Kickstarter deal in 16k(It is in depth reviewof poco x6)Review:1) Build quality : poco x6 build quality is decent  snowstorm white colour look really good.2)Display: display is superb I like it.3) camera: iam not a camera guy but believe me camera is average.4) Battery: when I unboxing poco X6 it took me 2 min to understood that poco x6 has serious battery drain issue even my 4 year old redmi note 9 pro give more battery backup than this brand new poco x6.5) performance: poco X6 performance is poor somtime my device got stuck and lag really disappointed.6) hyper os: hyper os is actually good  but after Updating for hyper os i don't like lock screen Fingerprint icon I mean a simple circle miui lock screen fingerprint icon is good. And they don't give any option to change fingerprint icon.7) charging speed: only one thing that i liked about poco x6 is charing speed it took 40-45 minutes from 0-100.8) Heating issue: yes poco x6 has heating issue.( And if you want my opinion on poco X6 so it is a decent phone but iam regretting to purchase it.)Funny fact it took me 2 min to complete poco x6 review and poco x6 drop 5 percentage battery really irritating .üò´üò´

The phone is very good.. Camera is nice according to this price range.. Sound quality is very good n clear.. The screen is awesome.. The camera module area is very big n the given back cover doesn't cover that area.. I would recommend to buy new back cover which covers the entire back except the lens.. I would prefer the round edges of other phones which feels better during holding the phone then poco x6 's boxy design.. The phone is very light weight.. I would prefer little more weight in phones which feels better to hold.. As a whole this is a very good phone to use in normal usage.. Recommend to all

Great entry level phone
","
Honestly,I could have done a review on,when I bought.So I just decided to use and wait for few months to make informed and non biased response on this phone's usage, performance, quality, delivery, software etcAnd I am happy say,The phone is truly best one on entry level so far (maybe I am overhyping it but from samsung galaxy j7 prime (2016) to Realme 12x 5G (2024) is massive jump in user experience.The phone has good quality build, pair it with stock phone cover that comes with, it is enough if you are not accidentally dropping it , even then the phone willing not get easily damaged  like few high end phones .I like the whole phone appearance of it,even the design are great.but weight seems to be bit of issue in long usage. Battery life it depends on your usage patterns but I recommend you not go for 120hz 5g with max brightness as it will drain fast with slot uf active process in background,use 60hz or Adaptive refresh and 5g with 50% brightnessCharging is the fun part,I truly love how every phones are having fast charging even wireless charging as normal,it's so satisfying and fast now a days to quick your phone to 100 from 0 and which lask prolly a week as mid level usage makes phone last 2 days .Sound quality is ok I could say,it could been better but adding or improving in that tiny space is hard and I can understand that.I could say it's great value for money device for those who want phones under 15k .

Front Camera defected & Amazon denied to Replace or Return. Worst Phone, Worst Service
","
After Opening the package, I started the phone and checked it. I observed that the front camera showed vertical lines. When I clicked a selfie, the lines were also visible in the photos. I contacted Amazon. First, they appointed a technician for a home visit. He asked for the job pin on the call, which I denied. Then, a lady assured me that after two days, it would be replaced or returned, but nothing happened. Then again, I contacted Amazon, and they refused to replace or return it. Worst phone, worst service.

Absolutely! The Realme 12X 5G is a solid mid-range phone with a smooth 120Hz display, a stylish design, and decent camera performance. It runs smoothly for daily tasks and light gaming thanks to its MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ 5G chip. The battery life is great, lasting a full day with a 5,000mAh battery and fast charging support. The realme UI 5.0 on Android 14 provides a user-friendly experience. Overall, it's a good value for its price, offering a nice balance of features for everyday use.

Had average expectations from this smartphone but still disappointed. The phone lags a lot. A LOT. Got slow within a month of buying. And the biggest disappointment, the phone was lagging so restarted it. When I entered the password to unlock, it showed incorrect. I've been unlocking the phone daily with the password. Worst experience ever. I don't recommend wasting money over these Chinese phones. Go for Samsung, Apple, Nothing etc.

Great choice under 20000 , excellent choice under 17000
","
Got this phone a week ago , and everything seems to be going smoothly so far . The phone is a great overall package with good cameras , powerful processor and a great multimedia expirence . For the price of under 17000 , there were no real life cons . The phone had a complete unboxing experience with a 67 watt charger , usb A-C cable , case , manual and the device itself . Although not a big issue but the cons that I faced in the device and found out by YouTube reviews are :1) camera stability - the phone supports 4k 30 fps video recording from the main camera and 1080p 30 fps from selfie camera . But while recording the stability of the phone is not great , specially when making videos while walking . The screen feels shaky and you'd have to be still or keep the phone in a stable surface to get best videos . Although it's not a huge issue and the unstability itself is minor , but for people who make videos often it could be irritating . I believe this might be fixed with software update , but still as of now it's an issue2) 4k video playback - while playing 4k videos , the videos are not playing smoothly , there are few jitters here and there but it's not a huge issue and may be fixed with software update as I feel the processor is capable of supporting smooth 4k playback .3) HDR color shifting - this is a problem that realme users have been facing for a long time in different devices , when playing a video the colours seem to shift a little when switching to HDR format . Although the colours are still great but it could be an issue for some . This issue. Could definitely be fixed by software update as the screen is capable of giving accurate colours in non HDR format , which means it's a software bug . Although we should also consider that it's been there for a while in a lot of realme devices , so it might not be fixed afterall .4) screen flickering - not something that I noticed myself yet , but an issue mentioned in a few youtube reviews I watched . The device does not has as good of an eye protection quality as other phones . The screen flickering isn't something that can be seen directly from a person's eye but could affect user experience in long terms . Due to screen flickering , the user's eyes could get tired quicker than usual which  could be a problem for long time users , specially those who use mobile in low light conditions like in night . I am not sure about this issue being fixed , as it could be an hardware problem .These were all the cons that I could detect and all of these are very minor issues that can be fixed with software update or could be worked around . The only reason I'm mentioning these is to keep the review as accurate as possible . As a student , I use the phone for casual gaming , multimedia and general usage . I feel like the mobile does an amazing job . It has great gaming specks for the price with support of  60 fps on bgmi and has HDR support (not on Netflix) the 5g connectivity is good and the downloading and streaming speeds are very good . A fast charging experience with 0 to 100 percent charge in under 45 minutes . It also has ufs 3.1 storage for better storage performance . Comes out of the box with Android 14 which is great with the promise of 2 years of major software updates and 3 years of security updates , which means you'd be able to experience a smooth and new experience for atleast 2 to 3 years .All these points make it a great choice for the price and unless you have a specific need from the device like high gaming performance then maybe check other deals out . But for me this phone is a 9 out of 10 overall package .

First of all I bought this phone because my old phone(Tecno pova 5 pro 5G) was stolen ü•∫üò≠üò≠ and I am very sad for this incident. After then I searched in internet for a best mobile under 16000 who is also give me the same storage and everything that I had in my old phone. Then I compared Motorola g64, lava Agni 2 5G and realme narzo 70 pro 5g and I find realme narzo 70 pro 5g is better than those 3 phones. I order this and it was delivered in 7 days the packaging was also good üëç.I used this phone almost 5 days. so Now let's talk about the pros and cons.Pros:-1- good display2- average camera but clicks good quality images3- stereo speakers4-great 5G connectivity5- ultra fast charging6- Also best for average gaming7- powerful performance8- Glass back9- Heavy storageNow let's talk about Cons1- battery draining quickly2- Heating issue not yet resolved3- camera picture not so much clearer4- Glass back can be broken5- refresh rate not working in all appsThis is all about realme narzo 70 pro 5g. If you want to buy it for camera then see other option. If you aren't a pro photographer then everything is good in this phone you can buy it without any hesitation. üòäüëç I got in 16248/- with coupon

This mobile is best in 16k price range with good camera and decent performance. Also the display is good with fingerprint sensor. I will recommend this mobile to those  who wants good camera and multimedia experience.It's battery is also last whole day if the usage is basic work.For gaming this mobile have mediatek processor which is not that optimised with graphics but for casual gaming this is enough.Display 120 hz is feel smooth and it's bright enough to use in outdoor.My final verdict is if ur budget is tight around 17k then u definitely choose this.

Review after more than 1 month usage
","
Writing this review after more than one month proper usage.You can see from the image that within 7 hours 45 minutes screen time(14 hours 22 minutes) from complete charging the amount of battery left is 14 percent which is disappointing. Also, while performing simple tasks it gets hot.It's camera quality is good. I'm satisfied with it. But for somedays the camera quality degraded and again it was upgraded.Today,(after 1 month) while clicking a photo through text scanner the camera was getting blur as if I'm using it from so many years.Sometimes I feel that there are some, not so much, hanging issues but they are not so clear i.e. it seems to be hanging but after 2-3 times it works normal.

Excellent Value for Money with Impressive Performance!
","
I've been using the realme NARZO 70 Pro 5G for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's an impressive device for its price range.Pros:Performance: The MediaTek Dimensity 7050 5G chipset delivers smooth and fast performance. I haven't noticed any lag, even while playing demanding games or multitasking with several apps open.Display: The AMOLED display is vibrant with deep blacks and punchy colors. Animations look fluid.Battery Life: The 5000mAh battery easily lasts a full day with heavy usage. The 67W fast charging is a game-changer, taking the battery from 0 to 100% in just about 50 minutes.Camera: The primary camera takes sharp and detailed photos, especially in good lighting conditions. The night mode is also surprisingly effective. The front camera captures clear selfies.5G Connectivity: I tested the 5G connectivity, and it works flawlessly, offering fast internet speeds and low latency.Cons:Build Quality: While the phone looks sleek, the glass back is fragile and needs to be under cover all the time-hiding the beauty. It does feel as premium. A good case is a must to keep it protected.Bloatware: There are a few pre-installed apps that I don't find useful, but most can be uninstalled or disabled.Conclusion: The realme NARZO 70 Pro 5G offers excellent performance, a stunning display, and reliable 5G connectivity at an affordable price. It's a great option for anyone looking for a feature-packed smartphone without breaking the bank. Highly recommended!

Camera low perfomance. Overall good
","
Camera perfomance is not good as expected. Low light perfomance is great. Camera doesn't give a detailed photo even in high resolution. Doesn't seem like 50mp even realme 2pro (16+2)mp camera gives a detailed picture. Photo of nearer object are great. Macro photo worst , totally waste 8 mp camera. Selfie camera very worst. 4k 30  fps only supports can't record a high resolution video smoothly.Struck occur on playing you tube 2160 p videos.Display is good. Super brightness. On the peak brightness in day time it gives pale colour image. Text are clear peak brightness good for basic use.Smooth perfomance.Heating problem arises slightly. Not much.Battery is good. Lasting for a day for a moderate use.Speaker are good Dolby support streo speakers. Not louder during phone call on speaker. But worthy..Design super.Network connectivity is awesome got 75+ mbps in my area.Gets slight warm during sometime.I don't know about gaming performance.

Realme Narzo 70 Pro 5G: Budget-Friendly PowerhouseThe Realme Narzo 70 Pro 5G strikes a balance between affordability and features. It boasts a smooth 120Hz display, a long-lasting 5000mAh battery with speedy 67W fast charging, and the latest Android 14 software. Plus, it throws in a unique party trick: Air Gestures for touchless control.Highlights:1. Sharp and Smooth Display: Enjoy a vivid and responsive 120Hz display, perfect for and scrolling.2. Rain or Shine: The innovative Rainwater Smart Touch lets you use the phone even with wet hands or a damp screen.3. Daylight Photography: Capture clear photos with the 50MP SONY IMX890 OIS main camera in bright conditions.4. Fast Charging Champion: Power up quickly with 67W fast charging and never miss a beat.5. Classic Convenience: Keep your wired headphones plugged in with the 3.5mm jack, and control smart devices using the IR emitter.Room for Improvement:1. Low-Light Woes: Photos can suffer from noise and lack detail in low-light environments.2. Missing Features: Stream enthusiasts might miss HDR support on platforms like Netflix.3. Slippery Grip: The design might feel a little too smooth for some users.4. Air Gestures Need Work: This feature is a neat idea but needs refinement for consistent performance.The Verdict:The Narzo 70 Pro 5G is a solid mid-range option for budget-conscious users who prioritize display quality, battery life, and a unique touchless control feature. However, low-light camera performance and potential software glitches with the UI lag are downsides to consider which can be optimised through software update. If the Air Gestures are a deal-breaker, this phone might be the best fit. For those seeking a well-rounded performer at a competitive price, the Narzo 70 Pro 5G offers a compelling package.Realme Narzo 7G Pro 5G: ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§ú‡§ü ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§Æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§®Realme Narzo 70 Pro 5G ‡§ï‡§ø‡§´‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ö ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§§‡•Å‡§≤‡§® ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§è‡§ï ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§• 120Hz ‡§°‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á, 5000mAh ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§≤‡§Ç‡§¨‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§Ø ‡§§‡§ï ‡§ö‡§≤‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•à‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• 67W ‡§´‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§≤‡•á‡§ü‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü Android 14 ‡§∏‡•â‡§´‡•ç‡§ü‡§µ‡•á‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á‡§ü‡•á ‡§π‡•Å‡§è ‡§Ü‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§π‡•Ä, ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ã‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞ - ‡§ü‡§ö‡§≤‡•á‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§Ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§è‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§™‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à.‡§Ö‡§π‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§‡•á‡§Ç:1. ‡§∂‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§™ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§• ‡§°‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á: ‡§ó‡•á‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•â‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§è‡§ï ‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡•â‡§®‡•ç‡§∏‡§ø‡§µ 120Hz ‡§°‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§®‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§≤‡•á‡§Ç.2. ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§∂ ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ß‡•Ç‡§™: ‡§á‡§®‡•ã‡§µ‡•á‡§ü‡§ø‡§µ ‡§∞‡•á‡§®‡§µ‡§æ‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ü‡§ö ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ó‡•Ä‡§≤‡•á ‡§π‡§æ‡§•‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§®‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§® ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§á‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§¶‡•á‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à.3. ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∞‡•ã‡§∂‡§®‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§´‡•ã‡§ü‡•ã‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§´‡•Ä: 50MP SONY IMX890 OIS ‡§Æ‡•á‡§® ‡§ï‡•à‡§Æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡•Ä ‡§∞‡•ã‡§∂‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•à‡§™‡•ç‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à.4. ‡§´‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ö‡•à‡§Ç‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§®: 67W ‡§´‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§ú‡§≤‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•á ‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•à‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§π‡•ã‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ö‡§ø‡§Ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç.5. ‡§Ü‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•Å‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡§æ‡§è‡§Ç: 3.5mm ‡§ú‡•à‡§ï ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§° ‡§π‡•á‡§°‡§´‡§º‡•ã‡§® ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡§ó ‡§á‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç, ‡§î‡§∞ IR ‡§è‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§â‡§™‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó ‡§ï‡§∞‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü ‡§°‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç.‡§∏‡•Å‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ó‡•Å‡§Ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§á‡§∂:1. ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§∂‡§®‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞‡•á‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä: ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§∂‡§®‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡§æ‡§µ‡§∞‡§£ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§´‡•ã‡§ü‡•ã ‡§ñ‡§∞‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§Ü ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§â‡§®‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§°‡§ø‡§ü‡•á‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à.2. ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§Æ‡•Ä: ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∂‡•å‡§ï‡•Ä‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã Netflix ‡§ú‡•à‡§∏‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§ü‡§´‡•â‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§™‡§∞ HDR ‡§∏‡§™‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡§≤‡•á‡§ó‡•Ä.3. ‡§´‡§ø‡§∏‡§≤‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§™: ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§á‡§∏‡§ï‡§æ ‡§°‡§ø‡§ú‡§æ‡§á‡§® ‡§•‡•ã‡§°‡§º‡§æ ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§• ‡§≤‡§ó ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à.4. ‡§è‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§∞‡•Ç‡§∞‡§§: ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§≤‡§ó‡§æ‡§§‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§™‡§∞‡§´‡•â‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§á‡§∏‡•á ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§¨‡•á‡§π‡§§‡§∞ ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§∞‡•Ç‡§∞‡§§ ‡§π‡•à.‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑:Narzo 70 Pro 5G ‡§¨‡§ú‡§ü ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡§ú‡§ó ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§è‡§ï ‡§¶‡§Æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§°-‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç‡§ú ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§°‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á ‡§ï‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ü‡•Ä, ‡§¨‡•à‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§≤‡§æ‡§á‡§´ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ã‡§ñ‡•á ‡§ü‡§ö‡§≤‡•á‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§Ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§≤ ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§•‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç. ‡§π‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ï‡§ø, ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§∂‡§®‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•à‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞‡§´‡•â‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§î‡§∞ UI ‡§≤‡•à‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§ø‡§§ ‡§∏‡•â‡§´‡•ç‡§ü‡§µ‡•á‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§°‡§º‡§¨‡§°‡§º‡•Ä ‡§á‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§ú‡•ã‡§∞ ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•Ç ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç, ‡§ú‡§ø‡§∏‡•á ‡§∏‡•â‡§´‡•ç‡§ü‡§µ‡•á‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§°‡•á‡§ü ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ú‡§∞‡§ø‡§è ‡§†‡•Ä‡§ï ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§è‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§¨‡§∏‡•á ‡§Ö‡§π‡§Æ ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§π‡•à, ‡§§‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§∏‡§¨‡§∏‡•á ‡§â‡§™‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ó ‡§è‡§ï ‡§ï‡§ø‡§´‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞‡§´‡•â‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§¶‡•á‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§ö‡§æ‡§π‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç, ‡§â‡§®‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è Narzo 70 Pro 5G ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ü‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑‡§ï ‡§™‡•à‡§ï‡•á‡§ú ‡§π‡•à.

Guys, if you're looking for a camera phone, just go for it nd don't ask questions... Although it's front nd wide view camera aren't that good but, as for the primary camera ( Sony imx890 sensor ) it's pretty good for this price range... One other issue is that the battery gets drained quickly (maybe I'm not doing it the right way; if anyone got a tip for me then I'll be thankful)  But overall it's a decent+ smartphone...

The Realme Narzo 70 Pro 5G stands out as a solid mid-range smartphone, especially for users looking for 5G capabilities without breaking the bank. Its strengths in display, performance, and battery life make it an attractive choice.

Overall, it‚Äôs a worthy contender in its segment, appealing to those who want a reliable smartphone with modern features.

Camera-9/10Without any doubt I can say that this phone has the best camera at the price range of 20k even better than iqoo z9 but selfie with night mode can be improved, otherwise the camera is perfect.Display-10/10The display is also excellent with 120 hz, Rain water touch and DCI-P3. The HDR content run smooth in my device but rarely it skips some frame. The display protection can be better like moto g64 which is cheaper than this offers gorilla glass 3 and poco x6 at the same price offers gorilla glass victus.Design 10/10 the design of this phone is very similar to that of iPhone. It feels premium in hands also is 195 gm but it doesn't feel like that.Performance - 9/10The performance of this device is also good in daily usage. But if you want a gaming phone under 20k then you should look for Iqoo z9. 1 have played games like cod, free fire and bgmi in this phone all runs smoothly even after 1 hr of constant gaming.

Have been using this since a month, and everything is working so smoothly, the display touch is incredible, camera is detailed and after update its has more better quality, Ois is not working properly, weight is good because of glass back but it gives premium feeling, little bit of heating issue during Gaming but not too much, and phone doesn't hang even while using multiple apps, overall best in this price range.

Using from last 07 days and below are the observations of the device1. It is an awesome phone in terms of storage, speed & camera (rear)2. Light in weight and High in specification3. Heavy Customization in this price range4. Charging Speed is simply superb - 31% to 77% in 20 Min - 67wt Charger5. Front Camera is also good but AI intervention is leading some unwanted effects.6. Rear Camera (Hi Resolution - Mode) with Flash is outstanding7. Video Recording - Dual Video Recording & 4K video recording are main key facts.8. Brightness is also its USP9. Color management is simply awesome10. Video on Youtube with wifi is just next level.11. Background remover is inbuilt feature of this phone and trust me it is also a killer feature with 99.99% of perfectionPurchased the same device for one of my friends as well.

Battery is a Huge Disappointment
","
This phone is good enough in most cases. Pictures are quite decent in this price segment. Phone will be usable for the next 4 years easily if its battery survives. So the biggest disappointment is the battery life. Just using the phone normally with no gaming or photography drains the battery quickly. If you're outside and use your phone then you can expect around 5 hours of screen on time which is annoying as heck. The phone lost 1% battery while just writing this review. Realme has to do something about it in the updates or I will not recommend this phone to anyone.

1.Display- Amoled display is excellent. Brightness is Good but sometimes colour gets disturbed. Smoothness refresh rate 120/60 fps2. Sound - high sound only stereo speakers.3. Quality - Average kinda looks plastic frame. But glass at back. No gorilla glass. Motorola is providing gorilla glass.4. Handling - sometimes get pain on one hand use.5. Battery - I don't play high end games like pubg & free fire. This phone is not made for that. battery last for 8-12 hrs using continuously. Superfast charge 67w. Charge from 20-80% it takes 20-25 mins. While charging it's getting warm. That's normal.6. Camera- better than average. Sony imx camera.7. Ram/storage- 8gb ram provided but system occupies 4gb and it run on remaining 4gb space.I bought it for 16k. My budget was 15k paid extra 1000. Phone looks premium feel in hand. And my main priority is storage and camera purpose. Not for gaming. If you r looking for gaming or photo clickers then go for budget above 23k.

Great choice under 20000 , excellent choice under 17000
","
Got this phone a week ago , and everything seems to be going smoothly so far . The phone is a great overall package with good cameras , powerful processor and a great multimedia expirence . For the price of under 17000 , there were no real life cons . The phone had a complete unboxing experience with a 67 watt charger , usb A-C cable , case , manual and the device itself . Although not a big issue but the cons that I faced in the device and found out by YouTube reviews are :1) camera stability - the phone supports 4k 30 fps video recording from the main camera and 1080p 30 fps from selfie camera . But while recording the stability of the phone is not great , specially when making videos while walking . The screen feels shaky and you'd have to be still or keep the phone in a stable surface to get best videos . Although it's not a huge issue and the unstability itself is minor , but for people who make videos often it could be irritating . I believe this might be fixed with software update , but still as of now it's an issue2) 4k video playback - while playing 4k videos , the videos are not playing smoothly , there are few jitters here and there but it's not a huge issue and may be fixed with software update as I feel the processor is capable of supporting smooth 4k playback .3) HDR color shifting - this is a problem that realme users have been facing for a long time in different devices , when playing a video the colours seem to shift a little when switching to HDR format . Although the colours are still great but it could be an issue for some . This issue. Could definitely be fixed by software update as the screen is capable of giving accurate colours in non HDR format , which means it's a software bug . Although we should also consider that it's been there for a while in a lot of realme devices , so it might not be fixed afterall .4) screen flickering - not something that I noticed myself yet , but an issue mentioned in a few youtube reviews I watched . The device does not has as good of an eye protection quality as other phones . The screen flickering isn't something that can be seen directly from a person's eye but could affect user experience in long terms . Due to screen flickering , the user's eyes could get tired quicker than usual which  could be a problem for long time users , specially those who use mobile in low light conditions like in night . I am not sure about this issue being fixed , as it could be an hardware problem .These were all the cons that I could detect and all of these are very minor issues that can be fixed with software update or could be worked around . The only reason I'm mentioning these is to keep the review as accurate as possible . As a student , I use the phone for casual gaming , multimedia and general usage . I feel like the mobile does an amazing job . It has great gaming specks for the price with support of  60 fps on bgmi and has HDR support (not on Netflix) the 5g connectivity is good and the downloading and streaming speeds are very good . A fast charging experience with 0 to 100 percent charge in under 45 minutes . It also has ufs 3.1 storage for better storage performance . Comes out of the box with Android 14 which is great with the promise of 2 years of major software updates and 3 years of security updates , which means you'd be able to experience a smooth and new experience for atleast 2 to 3 years .All these points make it a great choice for the price and unless you have a specific need from the device like high gaming performance then maybe check other deals out . But for me this phone is a 9 out of 10 overall package .

This mobile is best in 16k price range with good camera and decent performance. Also the display is good with fingerprint sensor. I will recommend this mobile to those  who wants good camera and multimedia experience.It's battery is also last whole day if the usage is basic work.For gaming this mobile have mediatek processor which is not that optimised with graphics but for casual gaming this is enough.Display 120 hz is feel smooth and it's bright enough to use in outdoor.My final verdict is if ur budget is tight around 17k then u definitely choose this.

Review after more than 1 month usage
","
Writing this review after more than one month proper usage.You can see from the image that within 7 hours 45 minutes screen time(14 hours 22 minutes) from complete charging the amount of battery left is 14 percent which is disappointing. Also, while performing simple tasks it gets hot.It's camera quality is good. I'm satisfied with it. But for somedays the camera quality degraded and again it was upgraded.Today,(after 1 month) while clicking a photo through text scanner the camera was getting blur as if I'm using it from so many years.Sometimes I feel that there are some, not so much, hanging issues but they are not so clear i.e. it seems to be hanging but after 2-3 times it works normal.

Excellent Value for Money with Impressive Performance!
","
I've been using the realme NARZO 70 Pro 5G for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's an impressive device for its price range.Pros:Performance: The MediaTek Dimensity 7050 5G chipset delivers smooth and fast performance. I haven't noticed any lag, even while playing demanding games or multitasking with several apps open.Display: The AMOLED display is vibrant with deep blacks and punchy colors. Animations look fluid.Battery Life: The 5000mAh battery easily lasts a full day with heavy usage. The 67W fast charging is a game-changer, taking the battery from 0 to 100% in just about 50 minutes.Camera: The primary camera takes sharp and detailed photos, especially in good lighting conditions. The night mode is also surprisingly effective. The front camera captures clear selfies.5G Connectivity: I tested the 5G connectivity, and it works flawlessly, offering fast internet speeds and low latency.Cons:Build Quality: While the phone looks sleek, the glass back is fragile and needs to be under cover all the time-hiding the beauty. It does feel as premium. A good case is a must to keep it protected.Bloatware: There are a few pre-installed apps that I don't find useful, but most can be uninstalled or disabled.Conclusion: The realme NARZO 70 Pro 5G offers excellent performance, a stunning display, and reliable 5G connectivity at an affordable price. It's a great option for anyone looking for a feature-packed smartphone without breaking the bank. Highly recommended!

Realme Narzo 70 Pro 5G: Budget-Friendly PowerhouseThe Realme Narzo 70 Pro 5G strikes a balance between affordability and features. It boasts a smooth 120Hz display, a long-lasting 5000mAh battery with speedy 67W fast charging, and the latest Android 14 software. Plus, it throws in a unique party trick: Air Gestures for touchless control.Highlights:1. Sharp and Smooth Display: Enjoy a vivid and responsive 120Hz display, perfect for and scrolling.2. Rain or Shine: The innovative Rainwater Smart Touch lets you use the phone even with wet hands or a damp screen.3.

Classic Convenience: Keep your wired headphones plugged in with the 3.5mm jack, and control smart devices using the IR emitter.Room for Improvement:1. Low-Light Woes: Photos can suffer from noise and lack detail in low-light environments.2. Missing Features: Stream enthusiasts might miss HDR support on platforms like Netflix.3. Slippery Grip: The design might feel a little too smooth for some users.4. Air Gestures Need Work: This feature is a neat idea but needs refinement for consistent performance.The Verdict:The Narzo 70 Pro 5G is a solid mid-range option for budget-conscious users who prioritize display quality, battery life, and a unique touchless control feature. However, low-light camera performance and potential software glitches with the UI lag are downsides to consider which can be optimised through software update. If the Air Gestures are a deal-breaker, this phone might be the best fit. For those seeking a well-rounded performer at a competitive price, the Narzo 70 Pro 5G offers a compelling package.Realme Narzo 7G Pro 5G: ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§ú‡§ü ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§Æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§®Realme Narzo 70 Pro 5G ‡§ï‡§ø‡§´‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ö ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§§‡•Å‡§≤‡§® ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§è‡§ï ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§• 120Hz ‡§°‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á, 5000mAh ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§≤‡§Ç‡§¨‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§Ø ‡§§‡§ï ‡§ö‡§≤‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•à‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• 67W ‡§´‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§≤‡•á‡§ü‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü Android 14 ‡§∏‡•â‡§´‡•ç‡§ü‡§µ‡•á‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á‡§ü‡•á ‡§π‡•Å‡§è ‡§Ü‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§π‡•Ä, ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ã‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞ - ‡§ü‡§ö‡§≤‡•á‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§Ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§è‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§™‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à.‡§Ö‡§π‡§Æ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§‡•á‡§Ç:1. ‡§∂‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§™ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§• ‡§°‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á: ‡§ó‡•á‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•â‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§è‡§ï ‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡•â‡§®‡•ç‡§∏‡§ø‡§µ 120Hz ‡§°‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§®‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§≤‡•á‡§Ç.2. ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§∂ ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ß‡•Ç‡§™: ‡§á‡§®‡•ã‡§µ‡•á‡§ü‡§ø‡§µ ‡§∞‡•á‡§®‡§µ‡§æ‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ü‡§ö ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ó‡•Ä‡§≤‡•á ‡§π‡§æ‡§•‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§®‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§® ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§á‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§¶‡•á‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à.3. ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∞‡•ã‡§∂‡§®‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§´‡•ã‡§ü‡•ã‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§´‡•Ä: 50MP SONY IMX890 OIS ‡§Æ‡•á‡§® ‡§ï‡•à‡§Æ‡§∞‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡•Ä ‡§∞‡•ã‡§∂‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•à‡§™‡•ç‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à.4. ‡§´‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ö‡•à‡§Ç‡§™‡§ø‡§Ø‡§®: 67W ‡§´‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§ú‡§≤‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•á ‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•à‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§π‡•ã‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ö‡§ø‡§Ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç.5. ‡§Ü‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•Å‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡§æ‡§è‡§Ç: 3.5mm ‡§ú‡•à‡§ï ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§° ‡§π‡•á‡§°‡§´‡§º‡•ã‡§® ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡§ó ‡§á‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç, ‡§î‡§∞ IR ‡§è‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§â‡§™‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó ‡§ï‡§∞‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü ‡§°‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç.‡§∏‡•Å‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ó‡•Å‡§Ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§á‡§∂:1. ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§∂‡§®‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞‡•á‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä: ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§∂‡§®‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡§æ‡§µ‡§∞‡§£ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§´‡•ã‡§ü‡•ã ‡§ñ‡§∞‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§Ü ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§â‡§®‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§°‡§ø‡§ü‡•á‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à.2. ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§Æ‡•Ä: ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∂‡•å‡§ï‡•Ä‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã Netflix ‡§ú‡•à‡§∏‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§ü‡§´‡•â‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§™‡§∞ HDR ‡§∏‡§™‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡§≤‡•á‡§ó‡•Ä.3. ‡§´‡§ø‡§∏‡§≤‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§™: ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§á‡§∏‡§ï‡§æ ‡§°‡§ø‡§ú‡§æ‡§á‡§® ‡§•‡•ã‡§°‡§º‡§æ ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§• ‡§≤‡§ó ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à.4. ‡§è‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§∞‡•Ç‡§∞‡§§: ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§≤‡§ó‡§æ‡§§‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§™‡§∞‡§´‡•â‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§á‡§∏‡•á ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§¨‡•á‡§π‡§§‡§∞ ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§∞‡•Ç‡§∞‡§§ ‡§π‡•à.‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑:Narzo 70 Pro 5G ‡§¨‡§ú‡§ü ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡§ú‡§ó ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§ú‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§è‡§ï ‡§¶‡§Æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§°-‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç‡§ú ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§°‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á ‡§ï‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ü‡•Ä, ‡§¨‡•à‡§ü‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§≤‡§æ‡§á‡§´ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ã‡§ñ‡•á ‡§ü‡§ö‡§≤‡•á‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§Ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§≤ ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§•‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç. ‡§π‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ï‡§ø, ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§∂‡§®‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•à‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞‡§´‡•â‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§î‡§∞ UI ‡§≤‡•à‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§ø‡§§ ‡§∏‡•â‡§´‡•ç‡§ü‡§µ‡•á‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§°‡§º‡§¨‡§°‡§º‡•Ä ‡§á‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§ú‡•ã‡§∞ ‡§™‡§π‡§≤‡•Ç ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç, ‡§ú‡§ø‡§∏‡•á ‡§∏‡•â‡§´‡•ç‡§ü‡§µ‡•á‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§°‡•á‡§ü ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ú‡§∞‡§ø‡§è ‡§†‡•Ä‡§ï ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§è‡§Ø‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§¨‡§∏‡•á ‡§Ö‡§π‡§Æ ‡§´‡•Ä‡§ö‡§∞ ‡§π‡•à, ‡§§‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§∏‡§¨‡§∏‡•á ‡§â‡§™‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∏‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à. ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ó ‡§è‡§ï ‡§ï‡§ø‡§´‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞‡§´‡•â‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç‡§∏ ‡§¶‡•á‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§ö‡§æ‡§π‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç, ‡§â‡§®‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è Narzo 70 Pro 5G ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ü‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑‡§ï ‡§™‡•à‡§ï‡•á‡§ú ‡§π‡•à.

Camera And Battery
","
Guys, if you're looking for a camera phone, just go for it nd don't ask questions... Although it's front nd wide view camera aren't that good but, as for the primary camera ( Sony imx890 sensor ) it's pretty good for this price range... One other issue is that the battery gets drained quickly (maybe I'm not doing it the right way; if anyone got a tip for me then I'll be thankful)  But overall it's a decent+ smartphone...

Nice Phone in this range
","
The Realme Narzo 70 Pro 5G stands out as a solid mid-range smartphone, especially for users looking for 5G capabilities without breaking the bank. Its strengths in display, performance, and battery life make it an attractive choice. However, potential buyers should weigh the cons, especially concerning camera performance and software experience. Overall, it‚Äôs a worthy contender in its segment, appealing to those who want a reliable smartphone with modern features.

Camera-9/10Without any doubt I can say that this phone has the best camera at the price range of 20k even better than iqoo z9 but selfie with night mode can be improved, otherwise the camera is perfect.Display-10/10The display is also excellent with 120 hz, Rain water touch and DCI-P3. The HDR content run smooth in my device but rarely it skips some frame. The display protection can be better like moto g64 which is cheaper than this offers gorilla glass 3 and poco x6 at the same price offers gorilla glass victus.Design 10/10 the design of this phone is very similar to that of iPhone. It feels premium in hands also is 195 gm but it doesn't feel like that.Performance - 9/10The performance of this device is also good in daily usage. But if you want a gaming phone under 20k then you should look for Iqoo z9. 1 have played games like cod, free fire and bgmi in this phone all runs smoothly even after 1 hr of constant gaming.

Have been using this since a month, and everything is working so smoothly, the display touch is incredible, camera is detailed and after update its has more better quality, Ois is not working properly, weight is good because of glass back but it gives premium feeling, little bit of heating issue during Gaming but not too much, and phone doesn't hang even while using multiple apps, overall best in this price range.

Using from last 07 days and below are the observations of the device1. It is an awesome phone in terms of storage, speed & camera (rear)2. Light in weight and High in specification3. Heavy Customization in this price range4. Charging Speed is simply superb - 31% to 77% in 20 Min - 67wt Charger5. Front Camera is also good but AI intervention is leading some unwanted effects.6. Rear Camera (Hi Resolution - Mode) with Flash is outstanding7. Video Recording - Dual Video Recording & 4K video recording are main key facts.8. Brightness is also its USP9. Color management is simply awesome10. Video on Youtube with wifi is just next level.11. Background remover is inbuilt feature of this phone and trust me it is also a killer feature with 99.99% of perfectionPurchased the same device for one of my friends as well.

Battery is a Huge Disappointment
","
This phone is good enough in most cases. Pictures are quite decent in this price segment. Phone will be usable for the next 4 years easily if its battery survives. So the biggest disappointment is the battery life. Just using the phone normally with no gaming or photography drains the battery quickly. If you're outside and use your phone then you can expect around 5 hours of screen on time which is annoying as heck. The phone lost 1% battery while just writing this review. Realme has to do something about it in the updates or I will not recommend this phone to anyone.

Good phone
","
1.Display- Amoled display is excellent. Brightness is Good but sometimes colour gets disturbed. Smoothness refresh rate 120/60 fps2. Sound - high sound only stereo speakers.3. Quality - Average kinda looks plastic frame. But glass at back. No gorilla glass. Motorola is providing gorilla glass.4. Handling - sometimes get pain on one hand use.5. Battery - I don't play high end games like pubg & free fire. This phone is not made for that. battery last for 8-12 hrs using continuously. Superfast charge 67w. Charge from 20-80% it takes 20-25 mins. While charging it's getting warm. That's normal.6. Camera- better than average. Sony imx camera.7. Ram/storage- 8gb ram provided but system occupies 4gb and it run on remaining 4gb space.I bought it for 16k. My budget was 15k paid extra 1000. Phone looks premium feel in hand. And my main priority is storage and camera purpose. Not for gaming. If you r looking for gaming or photo clickers then go for budget above 23k.

Remove the bloatware.4. Network connectivity is poor, isn't that great.5. Front Camera should be improved, should have been 32mp camera.

Most Detailed Review of the Realme Narzo 70x 5G you should read
","
The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a new entry in the competitive mid-range smartphone market. Known for delivering good value for money, Realme‚Äôs Narzo series often balances features and affordability well. With a focus on performance, display quality, and connectivity, the Narzo 70x 5G aims to attract users looking for a capable device without breaking the bank. In this review, we will delve into its key aspects, including design, display, performance, camera quality, battery life, and connectivity.**Design and Build Quality**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G comes in a striking Forest Green color that gives it a premium look. The design is modern and sleek, with a clean finish that is visually appealing. The device features a plastic back and frame, which is standard for its price range, but it is well-built and feels sturdy in hand. The phone is lightweight and ergonomically designed, making it comfortable for prolonged use.The front of the phone is dominated by a 6.5-inch display with slim bezels, and the rear houses a triple camera setup housed within a rectangular module. While the design is not particularly groundbreaking, it is functional and attractive for a mid-range device.**Display**One of the standout features of the Narzo 70x 5G is its 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display. This high refresh rate ensures smoother animations, improved responsiveness, and an overall more fluid visual experience. For users who enjoy gaming or frequently scroll through content, this feature can significantly enhance usability.The display itself is a 6.5-inch IPS LCD panel with Full HD+ resolution. It offers vibrant colors and decent brightness levels, making it suitable for most indoor and outdoor conditions. While it may not match the brightness and contrast ratIOS of high-end OLED panels, it is more than adequate for daily tasks, media consumption, and casual gaming.**Performance**Under the hood, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ chipset. This 6nm processor is designed to handle 5G connectivity and deliver a smooth performance for mid-range devices. Coupled with 8GB of RAM, the phone manages multitasking with ease, and app launches are swift.In everyday use, the Narzo 70x 5G performs well, handling tasks such as web browsing, social media, and video streaming without significant hiccups. For gaming, the device is capable of running popular titles at medium to high settings, though demanding games might require reduced graphics settings for optimal performance.The inclusion of 128GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, media, and files. For users who need more storage, the Narzo 70x also supports expandable storage via a microSD card slot, which adds flexibility for managing large files.**Camera Performance**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G features a triple camera setup on the rear, consisting of a 50MP primary sensor, a 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. The main 50MP camera performs well in various lighting conditions, capturing sharp and detailed images. The AI enhancements help in optimizing colors and improving photo quality, making the camera versatile for different shooting scenarIOS.The macro lens is useful for close-up shots, though it can sometimes struggle with focus and detail in low light. The depth sensor aids in creating bokeh effects for portrait shots, and while it works effectively, the results may not be as refined as those from higher-end devices.On the front, the Narzo 70x 5G sports a 16MP selfie camera that delivers good quality selfies. The camera app includes various modes and filters to enhance the user experience, and it performs admirably for social media and video calls.**Battery Life**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is equipped with a 5000mAh battery, which is a generous capacity for a mid-range phone. Combined with the efficient Dimensity 6100+ processor and the 120Hz display, the battery life is commendable. Users can expect a full day of moderate to heavy use, including web browsing, media consumption, and occasional gaming.The phone also comes with a 45W fast charger in the box, which is a significant advantage. The fast charging feature allows the device to quickly regain power, minimizing downtime and ensuring that users can get back to using their phone without extended waits.**Connectivity and Software**As the name suggests, the Narzo 70x 5G supports 5G connectivity, providing future-proofing for users looking to take advantage of the latest network technology. The device also includes other connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.1, and GPS.On the software front, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G runs on Realme UI, based on Android. The interface is user-friendly and includes various customization options, enhancing the overall user experience. However, the phone does come with some pre-installed bloatware, which may not be necessary for all users.**Positive Aspects**1. **High Refresh Rate Display**: The 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display enhances the overall visual experience, providing fluid animations and smoother interactions.2. **Solid Performance**: The Dimensity 6100+ chipset, combined with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth performance for everyday tasks and moderate gaming.3. **Good Battery Life**: The 5000mAh battery, along with 45W fast charging, offers long-lasting usage and quick recharging.4. **Expandable Storage**: The option to expand storage via microSD adds flexibility for managing files and media.5. **Attractive Design**: The Forest Green color and sleek design give the phone a premium feel, despite its plastic construction.**Negative Aspects**1. **Average Display Quality**: While the 120Hz refresh rate is a highlight, the display‚Äôs overall quality is typical for an IPS LCD and may not match the vibrant contrast of OLED screens.2. **Camera Performance**: While the 50MP main camera is competent, the additional sensors (macro and depth) may not provide significant improvements and can struggle in low light conditions.3. **Bloatware**: The pre-installed apps on Realme UI might not be useful for all users and can clutter the interface.4. **Plastic Build**: The use of plastic for the back and frame, while common in this price range, might not feel as premium as glass or metal alternatives.**Conclusion**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a well-rounded smartphone that offers a range of features catering to the mid-range market segment. Its 120Hz display, solid performance, and good battery life make it a competitive option. However, some limitations in display quality, camera performance, and bloatware should be considered. For users seeking a balance of performance and value, the Narzo 70x 5G is a strong contender, though it may not meet the needs of those looking for a high-end experience.

This phone delivers solid performance for its price range. The overall performance is smooth, though there can be occasional lags. Thankfully, there are no heating issues, even with heavy use.The camera quality is decent, but I did expect a bit more in terms of rear camera clarity. However, the front camera features are fantastic, perfect for selfies.Appearance-wise, I got the forest green color, and it looks stunning! It‚Äôs sleek, modern, and definitely stands out.One downside is the air gestures. They simply don't work. While the phone offers a few gesture-based features, none of them function as expected.The battery life is impressive. It easily lasts a full day, even with around 6-7 hours of continuous use.

Bought this around June 1st . Charging is good , battery backup is good , user interface is good . No heating issues so far. Camera is average, the photos I took are good but when I want to take photos in my room where light is not too much , that's where the camera sucks , front camera sucks too, not many features on camera video recording is also bad. You need extraordinary light or view as I shown above. I don't have much use of camera . Samsung provide better camera quality with this price range but I don't samsung's user interface thats why I bought this. Go with vivo or samsung if you want better photos. camera is 2.5/5.

Good looking phone
","
Bought this phone yesterday. And thought I'd write a review to help others make a wise decision regarding the phones in the current market.Looks: 5/5The phone is slim and feels really good in the hands. Loved the camera bulge as well.Accessories: 5/5Comes with a screen cover, a phone cover and a 45 w adapter, something you won't get with a Samsung phone. Saved me around 2,000 rupees in accessories alone.Battery and Charger: 4/5The battery is good, seems to last long, however the charging speed is awful for a 45 w charger. My Samsung used to charge at a better speed with a 18 w charger. I highly doubt that this phone charges at 45 w. Felt like 18w charging speed in my honest opinion. I'm not happy with the charging speed.Touch: 3/5When I'm typing, I can feel the touch isn't great. Have to press on a key twice or thrice sometimes. But then I had a similar experience with my friend's mid range Redmi as well. These budget phones don't have a great touch quality. Samsung provides better touch in this price range.Finger print sensor: 4/5It doesn't open at once as soon as u touch the side button. You have to PRESS the button on order for the finger print sensor to work. Something that I didn't face an issue with when I had Samsung M15Camera: 4/5The rear camera takes good pics keeping this price range in mind. The front camera comes with an in built beauty mode that brightens faces. For this price range I'd say the camera does a good job.Performance: 5/5I haven't faced any lags yet on my 8 GB ram version. I'd suggest to go for 8 GB ram for smooth functions. Anything lower than this will create problems.Voice quality: 4/5I felt like my Samsung M15 had better voice quality than this phone, but still it does an alright job.Display: 4/5Comes with an lcd screen, not amoled which might not be great, but still it does a decent job. At least the risk of developing green lines in LCD screen is low.Bloatware: 5/5Comes with in built Glance app and other useless apps. But on the bright side you can easily uninstall these bloatwares. I disabled my Glance app as well and now not facing any issues with Bloatwares. REMEMBER, other phones in this range do not come with an option to disable the Glance app and some other bloatwares.Overall: I got this phone at 13.5k, and with 8 GB of ram this phone hasn't disappointed me yet. I'd say this phone is the best option in this price range. Go for it if u listen to me. Samsung phones will cost u 2,000 extra as they don't come with any accessories.

Geeting a 5G phone under this price range is firstly unbelievable but I got it after searching various phones, comparing them I thought finally it would be the best phone. After getting this phone I was not at all disappointed it is more than my expectations.Everything is ok but some lag in apps are taking place but it is complained and a inspection was also taken by the company person in just 24 hours and everything was rectified. If you looking a 5G phone under this range just go for it and will never disappointed.

Hangs a bit of photos are not deleted
","
Noticed lags after a month of use. That said I have not yet factory reset it and if I delete old photos and videos then it starts working well. But considering it has a big storage what is the point of it starts lagging for few 150 photos. Max size of pic and video folder is 6 GB which should ideally be manageable. But sadly no. Other than that the phone is fine. Pics get enhanced with AI. Software updates are coming. Display quality is good and brightness is good too. So as long as you keep clearing unnecessary data and keep clearing cache, phone works fine.

Value for Money with Some Impressive Features
","
I recently bought the Realme 70x 5G during the Great Indian Sale, and after using it for a while, I must say I‚Äôm quite impressed! The phone comes with a fantastic FHD+ display, which makes watching videos and browsing a great experience. One of the best parts is that it includes a charger in the box, and the fast charging feature is really efficient ‚Äì it charges 50% in just about 35 minutes.There are some pre-installed apps (bloatware), but they can be easily removed, so it‚Äôs not a big issue. The gesture mode is a bit of a hit-and-miss, but overall, the phone has many features that don‚Äôt get much publicity. For example, you can increase the phone‚Äôs RAM in the settings, which is a neat feature, and there‚Äôs a cool iPhone-like toggle near the camera.As for the camera, it‚Äôs decent ‚Äì nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done. Overall, this phone is packed with value for its price. Let's see how it works in the future

Hii everyone here i am writing the review of narzo 70x . after 2 weeks of uses. i have 8-128 grabbed the deal at 11499 and got 100 rs cashback in GIF  Pros1. best look my first impression is very good look perfect , slim ,light weight, blue colour shine inn light2. bigg battery and fast charging it fill easy run 1 or even 1.5 day of normal to medium uses even on  heavy uses like gaming streaming it will run continuously 7-8 hr easily3. no lag expression played CODM (10GB) no lag no frame drop  Cons1. biggest problem that i have faced is sound quality sound cracks after 80 percent and you will not hear  anything before 80- percent it is very disappointing all aspectsare great but sound is suckkk low  volume2. FHD+ display yes i know i will not get amoled at this price range but sometime i said sometime you  will feel it is dull display3. bigg round camera it worse the the look and colour i like only simple small size camera like before  and now like samsung a14  Conclusion  definitely you should goo for this one if cons doesn't matter to you i hope sound problem realme  resolve with update

Honest review. Bought it for dad. The phone has very good display. But power and performance wise is ok ok, I would say below average. As my dad is not a heavy phone user , so it gets the work done like email, watsapp, facebook lite, etc etc.  Go for it only if you are not a heavy user. And by the way he only have 10 15 external apps that he has installed. ‚úåÔ∏è

Camera Quality: The camera, especially the micro camera, is excellent. The normal camera is also decent and meets expectations.Performance: The performance is top-notch, particularly for the 8GB RAM and 128GB storage variant. There's no lag, making it ideal for multitasking and running demanding applications smoothly.Lack of FM Radio: The device does not come with an FM radio, and there isn't even an app available to compensate for this feature. This might be a drawback for users who enjoy listening to radio stations directly on their phones.

Most Detailed Review of the Realme Narzo 70x 5G you should read
","
The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a new entry in the competitive mid-range smartphone market. Known for delivering good value for money, Realme‚Äôs Narzo series often balances features and affordability well. With a focus on performance, display quality, and connectivity, the Narzo 70x 5G aims to attract users looking for a capable device without breaking the bank. In this review, we will delve into its key aspects, including design, display, performance, camera quality, battery life, and connectivity.**Design and Build Quality**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G comes in a striking Forest Green color that gives it a premium look. The design is modern and sleek, with a clean finish that is visually appealing. The device features a plastic back and frame, which is standard for its price range, but it is well-built and feels sturdy in hand. The phone is lightweight and ergonomically designed, making it comfortable for prolonged use.The front of the phone is dominated by a 6.5-inch display with slim bezels, and the rear houses a triple camera setup housed within a rectangular module. While the design is not particularly groundbreaking, it is functional and attractive for a mid-range device.**Display**One of the standout features of the Narzo 70x 5G is its 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display. This high refresh rate ensures smoother animations, improved responsiveness, and an overall more fluid visual experience. For users who enjoy gaming or frequently scroll through content, this feature can significantly enhance usability.The display itself is a 6.5-inch IPS LCD panel with Full HD+ resolution. It offers vibrant colors and decent brightness levels, making it suitable for most indoor and outdoor conditions. While it may not match the brightness and contrast ratIOS of high-end OLED panels, it is more than adequate for daily tasks, media consumption, and casual gaming.**Performance**Under the hood, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ chipset. This 6nm processor is designed to handle 5G connectivity and deliver a smooth performance for mid-range devices. Coupled with 8GB of RAM, the phone manages multitasking with ease, and app launches are swift.In everyday use, the Narzo 70x 5G performs well, handling tasks such as web browsing, social media, and video streaming without significant hiccups. For gaming, the device is capable of running popular titles at medium to high settings, though demanding games might require reduced graphics settings for optimal performance.The inclusion of 128GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, media, and files. For users who need more storage, the Narzo 70x also supports expandable storage via a microSD card slot, which adds flexibility for managing large files.**Camera Performance**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G features a triple camera setup on the rear, consisting of a 50MP primary sensor, a 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. The main 50MP camera performs well in various lighting conditions, capturing sharp and detailed images. The AI enhancements help in optimizing colors and improving photo quality, making the camera versatile for different shooting scenarIOS.The macro lens is useful for close-up shots, though it can sometimes struggle with focus and detail in low light. The depth sensor aids in creating bokeh effects for portrait shots, and while it works effectively, the results may not be as refined as those from higher-end devices.On the front, the Narzo 70x 5G sports a 16MP selfie camera that delivers good quality selfies. The camera app includes various modes and filters to enhance the user experience, and it performs admirably for social media and video calls.**Battery Life**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is equipped with a 5000mAh battery, which is a generous capacity for a mid-range phone. Combined with the efficient Dimensity 6100+ processor and the 120Hz display, the battery life is commendable. Users can expect a full day of moderate to heavy use, including web browsing, media consumption, and occasional gaming.The phone also comes with a 45W fast charger in the box, which is a significant advantage. The fast charging feature allows the device to quickly regain power, minimizing downtime and ensuring that users can get back to using their phone without extended waits.**Connectivity and Software**As the name suggests, the Narzo 70x 5G supports 5G connectivity, providing future-proofing for users looking to take advantage of the latest network technology. The device also includes other connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.1, and GPS.On the software front, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G runs on Realme UI, based on Android. The interface is user-friendly and includes various customization options, enhancing the overall user experience. However, the phone does come with some pre-installed bloatware, which may not be necessary for all users.**Positive Aspects**1. **High Refresh Rate Display**: The 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display enhances the overall visual experience, providing fluid animations and smoother interactions.2. **Solid Performance**: The Dimensity 6100+ chipset, combined with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth performance for everyday tasks and moderate gaming.3. **Good Battery Life**: The 5000mAh battery, along with 45W fast charging, offers long-lasting usage and quick recharging.4. **Expandable Storage**: The option to expand storage via microSD adds flexibility for managing files and media.5. **Attractive Design**: The Forest Green color and sleek design give the phone a premium feel, despite its plastic construction.**Negative Aspects**1. **Average Display Quality**: While the 120Hz refresh rate is a highlight, the display‚Äôs overall quality is typical for an IPS LCD and may not match the vibrant contrast of OLED screens.2. **Camera Performance**: While the 50MP main camera is competent, the additional sensors (macro and depth) may not provide significant improvements and can struggle in low light conditions.3. **Bloatware**: The pre-installed apps on Realme UI might not be useful for all users and can clutter the interface.4. **Plastic Build**: The use of plastic for the back and frame, while common in this price range, might not feel as premium as glass or metal alternatives.**Conclusion**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a well-rounded smartphone that offers a range of features catering to the mid-range market segment. Its 120Hz display, solid performance, and good battery life make it a competitive option. However, some limitations in display quality, camera performance, and bloatware should be considered. For users seeking a balance of performance and value, the Narzo 70x 5G is a strong contender, though it may not meet the needs of those looking for a high-end experience.

Good looking phone
","
Bought this phone yesterday. And thought I'd write a review to help others make a wise decision regarding the phones in the current market.Looks: 5/5The phone is slim and feels really good in the hands. Loved the camera bulge as well.Accessories: 5/5Comes with a screen cover, a phone cover and a 45 w adapter, something you won't get with a Samsung phone. Saved me around 2,000 rupees in accessories alone.Battery and Charger: 4/5The battery is good, seems to last long, however the charging speed is awful for a 45 w charger. My Samsung used to charge at a better speed with a 18 w charger. I highly doubt that this phone charges at 45 w. Felt like 18w charging speed in my honest opinion. I'm not happy with the charging speed.Touch: 3/5When I'm typing, I can feel the touch isn't great. Have to press on a key twice or thrice sometimes. But then I had a similar experience with my friend's mid range Redmi as well. These budget phones don't have a great touch quality. Samsung provides better touch in this price range.Finger print sensor: 4/5It doesn't open at once as soon as u touch the side button. You have to PRESS the button on order for the finger print sensor to work. Something that I didn't face an issue with when I had Samsung M15Camera: 4/5The rear camera takes good pics keeping this price range in mind. The front camera comes with an in built beauty mode that brightens faces. For this price range I'd say the camera does a good job.Performance: 5/5I haven't faced any lags yet on my 8 GB ram version. I'd suggest to go for 8 GB ram for smooth functions. Anything lower than this will create problems.Voice quality: 4/5I felt like my Samsung M15 had better voice quality than this phone, but still it does an alright job.Display: 4/5Comes with an lcd screen, not amoled which might not be great, but still it does a decent job. At least the risk of developing green lines in LCD screen is low.Bloatware: 5/5Comes with in built Glance app and other useless apps. But on the bright side you can easily uninstall these bloatwares. I disabled my Glance app as well and now not facing any issues with Bloatwares. REMEMBER, other phones in this range do not come with an option to disable the Glance app and some other bloatwares.Overall: I got this phone at 13.5k, and with 8 GB of ram this phone hasn't disappointed me yet. I'd say this phone is the best option in this price range. Go for it if u listen to me. Samsung phones will cost u 2,000 extra as they don't come with any accessories.

Geeting a 5G phone under this price range is firstly unbelievable but I got it after searching various phones, comparing them I thought finally it would be the best phone. After getting this phone I was not at all disappointed it is more than my expectations.Everything is ok but some lag in apps are taking place but it is complained and a inspection was also taken by the company person in just 24 hours and everything was rectified. If you looking a 5G phone under this range just go for it and will never disappointed.

Hangs a bit of photos are not deleted
","
Noticed lags after a month of use. That said I have not yet factory reset it and if I delete old photos and videos then it starts working well. But considering it has a big storage what is the point of it starts lagging for few 150 photos. Max size of pic and video folder is 6 GB which should ideally be manageable. But sadly no. Other than that the phone is fine. Pics get enhanced with AI. Software updates are coming. Display quality is good and brightness is good too. So as long as you keep clearing unnecessary data and keep clearing cache, phone works fine.

Value for Money with Some Impressive Features
","
I recently bought the Realme 70x 5G during the Great Indian Sale, and after using it for a while, I must say I‚Äôm quite impressed! The phone comes with a fantastic FHD+ display, which makes watching videos and browsing a great experience. One of the best parts is that it includes a charger in the box, and the fast charging feature is really efficient ‚Äì it charges 50% in just about 35 minutes.There are some pre-installed apps (bloatware), but they can be easily removed, so it‚Äôs not a big issue. The gesture mode is a bit of a hit-and-miss, but overall, the phone has many features that don‚Äôt get much publicity. For example, you can increase the phone‚Äôs RAM in the settings, which is a neat feature, and there‚Äôs a cool iPhone-like toggle near the camera.As for the camera, it‚Äôs decent ‚Äì nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done. Overall, this phone is packed with value for its price. Let's see how it works in the future

Hii everyone here i am writing the review of narzo 70x . after 2 weeks of uses. i have 8-128 grabbed the deal at 11499 and got 100 rs cashback in GIF  Pros1. best look my first impression is very good look perfect , slim ,light weight, blue colour shine inn light2. bigg battery and fast charging it fill easy run 1 or even 1.5 day of normal to medium uses even on  heavy uses like gaming streaming it will run continuously 7-8 hr easily3. no lag expression played CODM (10GB) no lag no frame drop  Cons1. biggest problem that i have faced is sound quality sound cracks after 80 percent and you will not hear  anything before 80- percent it is very disappointing all aspectsare great but sound is suckkk low  volume2. FHD+ display yes i know i will not get amoled at this price range but sometime i said sometime you  will feel it is dull display3. bigg round camera it worse the the look and colour i like only simple small size camera like before  and now like samsung a14  Conclusion  definitely you should goo for this one if cons doesn't matter to you i hope sound problem realme  resolve with update

Honest review. Bought it for dad. The phone has very good display. But power and performance wise is ok ok, I would say below average. As my dad is not a heavy phone user , so it gets the work done like email, watsapp, facebook lite, etc etc.  Go for it only if you are not a heavy user. And by the way he only have 10 15 external apps that he has installed. ‚úåÔ∏è

Bought this around June 1st . Charging is good , battery backup is good , user interface is good . No heating issues so far. Camera is average, the photos I took are good but when I want to take photos in my room where light is not too much , that's where the camera sucks , front camera sucks too, not many features on camera video recording is also bad. You need extraordinary light or view as I shown above. I don't have much use of camera . Samsung provide better camera quality with this price range but I don't samsung's user interface thats why I bought this. Go with vivo or samsung if you want better photos. camera is 2.5/5.

Camera Quality: The camera, especially the micro camera, is excellent. The normal camera is also decent and meets expectations.Performance: The performance is top-notch, particularly for the 8GB RAM and 128GB storage variant. There's no lag, making it ideal for multitasking and running demanding applications smoothly.Lack of FM Radio: The device does not come with an FM radio, and there isn't even an app available to compensate for this feature. This might be a drawback for users who enjoy listening to radio stations directly on their phones.

Most Detailed Review of the Realme Narzo 70x 5G you should read
","
The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a new entry in the competitive mid-range smartphone market. Known for delivering good value for money, Realme‚Äôs Narzo series often balances features and affordability well. With a focus on performance, display quality, and connectivity, the Narzo 70x 5G aims to attract users looking for a capable device without breaking the bank. In this review, we will delve into its key aspects, including design, display, performance, camera quality, battery life, and connectivity.**Design and Build Quality**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G comes in a striking Forest Green color that gives it a premium look. The design is modern and sleek, with a clean finish that is visually appealing. The device features a plastic back and frame, which is standard for its price range, but it is well-built and feels sturdy in hand. The phone is lightweight and ergonomically designed, making it comfortable for prolonged use.The front of the phone is dominated by a 6.5-inch display with slim bezels, and the rear houses a triple camera setup housed within a rectangular module. While the design is not particularly groundbreaking, it is functional and attractive for a mid-range device.**Display**One of the standout features of the Narzo 70x 5G is its 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display. This high refresh rate ensures smoother animations, improved responsiveness, and an overall more fluid visual experience. For users who enjoy gaming or frequently scroll through content, this feature can significantly enhance usability.The display itself is a 6.5-inch IPS LCD panel with Full HD+ resolution. It offers vibrant colors and decent brightness levels, making it suitable for most indoor and outdoor conditions. While it may not match the brightness and contrast ratIOS of high-end OLED panels, it is more than adequate for daily tasks, media consumption, and casual gaming.**Performance**Under the hood, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ chipset. This 6nm processor is designed to handle 5G connectivity and deliver a smooth performance for mid-range devices. Coupled with 8GB of RAM, the phone manages multitasking with ease, and app launches are swift.In everyday use, the Narzo 70x 5G performs well, handling tasks such as web browsing, social media, and video streaming without significant hiccups. For gaming, the device is capable of running popular titles at medium to high settings, though demanding games might require reduced graphics settings for optimal performance.The inclusion of 128GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, media, and files. For users who need more storage, the Narzo 70x also supports expandable storage via a microSD card slot, which adds flexibility for managing large files.**Camera Performance**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G features a triple camera setup on the rear, consisting of a 50MP primary sensor, a 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. The main 50MP camera performs well in various lighting conditions, capturing sharp and detailed images. The AI enhancements help in optimizing colors and improving photo quality, making the camera versatile for different shooting scenarIOS.The macro lens is useful for close-up shots, though it can sometimes struggle with focus and detail in low light. The depth sensor aids in creating bokeh effects for portrait shots, and while it works effectively, the results may not be as refined as those from higher-end devices.On the front, the Narzo 70x 5G sports a 16MP selfie camera that delivers good quality selfies. The camera app includes various modes and filters to enhance the user experience, and it performs admirably for social media and video calls.**Battery Life**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is equipped with a 5000mAh battery, which is a generous capacity for a mid-range phone. Combined with the efficient Dimensity 6100+ processor and the 120Hz display, the battery life is commendable. Users can expect a full day of moderate to heavy use, including web browsing, media consumption, and occasional gaming.The phone also comes with a 45W fast charger in the box, which is a significant advantage. The fast charging feature allows the device to quickly regain power, minimizing downtime and ensuring that users can get back to using their phone without extended waits.**Connectivity and Software**As the name suggests, the Narzo 70x 5G supports 5G connectivity, providing future-proofing for users looking to take advantage of the latest network technology. The device also includes other connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.1, and GPS.On the software front, the Realme Narzo 70x 5G runs on Realme UI, based on Android. The interface is user-friendly and includes various customization options, enhancing the overall user experience. However, the phone does come with some pre-installed bloatware, which may not be necessary for all users.**Positive Aspects**1. **High Refresh Rate Display**: The 120Hz Ultra Smooth Display enhances the overall visual experience, providing fluid animations and smoother interactions.2. **Solid Performance**: The Dimensity 6100+ chipset, combined with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth performance for everyday tasks and moderate gaming.3. **Good Battery Life**: The 5000mAh battery, along with 45W fast charging, offers long-lasting usage and quick recharging.4. **Expandable Storage**: The option to expand storage via microSD adds flexibility for managing files and media.5. **Attractive Design**: The Forest Green color and sleek design give the phone a premium feel, despite its plastic construction.**Negative Aspects**1. **Average Display Quality**: While the 120Hz refresh rate is a highlight, the display‚Äôs overall quality is typical for an IPS LCD and may not match the vibrant contrast of OLED screens.2. **Camera Performance**: While the 50MP main camera is competent, the additional sensors (macro and depth) may not provide significant improvements and can struggle in low light conditions.3. **Bloatware**: The pre-installed apps on Realme UI might not be useful for all users and can clutter the interface.4. **Plastic Build**: The use of plastic for the back and frame, while common in this price range, might not feel as premium as glass or metal alternatives.**Conclusion**The Realme Narzo 70x 5G is a well-rounded smartphone that offers a range of features catering to the mid-range market segment. Its 120Hz display, solid performance, and good battery life make it a competitive option. However, some limitations in display quality, camera performance, and bloatware should be considered. For users seeking a balance of performance and value, the Narzo 70x 5G is a strong contender, though it may not meet the needs of those looking for a high-end experience.

This phone delivers solid performance for its price range. The overall performance is smooth, though there can be occasional lags. Thankfully, there are no heating issues, even with heavy use.The camera quality is decent, but I did expect a bit more in terms of rear camera clarity. However, the front camera features are fantastic, perfect for selfies.Appearance-wise, I got the forest green color, and it looks stunning! It‚Äôs sleek, modern, and definitely stands out.One downside is the air gestures. They simply don't work. While the phone offers a few gesture-based features, none of them function as expected.The battery life is impressive. It easily lasts a full day, even with around 6-7 hours of continuous use. The phone's size is also spot on‚Äîcomfortable to hold and carry around.Overall, for its price, this phone is one of the best budget options available, despite a few minor flaws.

Bought this around June 1st . Charging is good , battery backup is good , user interface is good . No heating issues so far. Camera is average, the photos I took are good but when I want to take photos in my room where light is not too much , that's where the camera sucks , front camera sucks too, not many features on camera video recording is also bad. You need extraordinary light or view as I shown above. I don't have much use of camera . Samsung provide better camera quality with this price range but I don't samsung's user interface thats why I bought this. Go with vivo or samsung if you want better photos. camera is 2.5/5.

Good looking phone
","
Bought this phone yesterday. And thought I'd write a review to help others make a wise decision regarding the phones in the current market.Looks: 5/5The phone is slim and feels really good in the hands. Loved the camera bulge as well.Accessories: 5/5Comes with a screen cover, a phone cover and a 45 w adapter, something you won't get with a Samsung phone. Saved me around 2,000 rupees in accessories alone.Battery and Charger: 4/5The battery is good, seems to last long, however the charging speed is awful for a 45 w charger. My Samsung used to charge at a better speed with a 18 w charger. I highly doubt that this phone charges at 45 w. Felt like 18w charging speed in my honest opinion. I'm not happy with the charging speed.Touch: 3/5When I'm typing, I can feel the touch isn't great. Have to press on a key twice or thrice sometimes. But then I had a similar experience with my friend's mid range Redmi as well. These budget phones don't have a great touch quality. Samsung provides better touch in this price range.Finger print sensor: 4/5It doesn't open at once as soon as u touch the side button. You have to PRESS the button on order for the finger print sensor to work. Something that I didn't face an issue with when I had Samsung M15Camera: 4/5The rear camera takes good pics keeping this price range in mind. The front camera comes with an in built beauty mode that brightens faces. For this price range I'd say the camera does a good job.Performance: 5/5I haven't faced any lags yet on my 8 GB ram version. I'd suggest to go for 8 GB ram for smooth functions. Anything lower than this will create problems.Voice quality: 4/5I felt like my Samsung M15 had better voice quality than this phone, but still it does an alright job.Display: 4/5Comes with an lcd screen, not amoled which might not be great, but still it does a decent job. At least the risk of developing green lines in LCD screen is low.Bloatware: 5/5Comes with in built Glance app and other useless apps. But on the bright side you can easily uninstall these bloatwares. I disabled my Glance app as well and now not facing any issues with Bloatwares. REMEMBER, other phones in this range do not come with an option to disable the Glance app and some other bloatwares.Overall: I got this phone at 13.5k, and with 8 GB of ram this phone hasn't disappointed me yet. I'd say this phone is the best option in this price range. Go for it if u listen to me. Samsung phones will cost u 2,000 extra as they don't come with any accessories.

Geeting a 5G phone under this price range is firstly unbelievable but I got it after searching various phones, comparing them I thought finally it would be the best phone. After getting this phone I was not at all disappointed it is more than my expectations.Everything is ok but some lag in apps are taking place but it is complained and a inspection was also taken by the company person in just 24 hours and everything was rectified. If you looking a 5G phone under this range just go for it and will never disappointed.

Touch sensor is not so responsive, battery drains more after 1-2 hours of usage. Cannot recommend for Gaming or Long hours usage. Heating issue is also there. Ram should have been 8 GB or more, in this phone only 4gb expandable option is there. Camera is usual in which we see in all realme phone.

This is the best phone under 12k now.Sound quality is best it can upto 200% of volume means a ultra volume feature. This budget phone has a decent camera but nice you can click a high quality picture.Its brightness is about good you can use easily in sunlight.It has some lag issues but it works proper when you update your system.  I suggest everyone who has low budget can afford it this is the best time to buy. In great indian festival,8/128 variant is only in around 11950rs.Thanks for reading my suggestion üáÆüá≥.

Hangs a bit of photos are not deleted
","
Noticed lags after a month of use. That said I have not yet factory reset it and if I delete old photos and videos then it starts working well. But considering it has a big storage what is the point of it starts lagging for few 150 photos. Max size of pic and video folder is 6 GB which should ideally be manageable. But sadly no. Other than that the phone is fine. Pics get enhanced with AI. Software updates are coming. Display quality is good and brightness is good too. So as long as you keep clearing unnecessary data and keep clearing cache, phone works fine.

Value for Money with Some Impressive Features
","
I recently bought the Realme 70x 5G during the Great Indian Sale, and after using it for a while, I must say I‚Äôm quite impressed! The phone comes with a fantastic FHD+ display, which makes watching videos and browsing a great experience. One of the best parts is that it includes a charger in the box, and the fast charging feature is really efficient ‚Äì it charges 50% in just about 35 minutes.There are some pre-installed apps (bloatware), but they can be easily removed, so it‚Äôs not a big issue. The gesture mode is a bit of a hit-and-miss, but overall, the phone has many features that don‚Äôt get much publicity. For example, you can increase the phone‚Äôs RAM in the settings, which is a neat feature, and there‚Äôs a cool iPhone-like toggle near the camera.As for the camera, it‚Äôs decent ‚Äì nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done. Overall, this phone is packed with value for its price. Let's see how it works in the future

best in class let me details its pros and cons

Hii everyone here i am writing the review of narzo 70x . after 2 weeks of uses. i have 8-128 grabbed the deal at 11499 and got 100 rs cashback in GIF  Pros1. best look my first impression is very good look perfect , slim ,light weight, blue colour shine inn light2. bigg battery and fast charging it fill easy run 1 or even 1.5 day of normal to medium uses even on  heavy uses like gaming streaming it will run continuously 7-8 hr easily3. no lag expression played CODM (10GB) no lag no frame drop  Cons1. biggest problem that i have faced is sound quality sound cracks after 80 percent and you will not hear  anything before 80- percent it is very disappointing all aspectsare great but sound is suckkk low  volume2. FHD+ display yes i know i will not get amoled at this price range but sometime i said sometime you  will feel it is dull display3. bigg round camera it worse the the look and colour i like only simple small size camera like before  and now like samsung a14  Conclusion  definitely you should goo for this one if cons doesn't matter to you i hope sound problem realme  resolve with update

Honest review. Bought it for dad. The phone has very good display. But power and performance wise is ok ok, I would say below average. As my dad is not a heavy phone user , so it gets the work done like email, watsapp, facebook lite, etc etc.  Go for it only if you are not a heavy user. And by the way he only have 10 15 external apps that he has installed. ‚úåÔ∏è

Review

Camera Quality: The camera, especially the micro camera, is excellent. The normal camera is also decent and meets expectations.Performance: The performance is top-notch, particularly for the 8GB RAM and 128GB storage variant. There's no lag, making it ideal for multitasking and running demanding applications smoothly.Lack of FM Radio: The device does not come with an FM radio, and there isn't even an app available to compensate for this feature. This might be a drawback for users who enjoy listening to radio stations directly on their phones.

Okay for basic use, but it falls short in a few key areas. The charging speed is not as fast as expected, and the battery drains quicker than anticipated. The camera quality is average, not very impressive in low-light conditions. While performance is decent for casual usage, it lags during multitasking or when running heavier apps. Overall, it's good for light usage, but if you're looking for more efficiency, this may not be the best option.

It can do basic task with ease.- Build quality is good.- Phone screen is huge(I am not big fan of huge screens though).- Supports all basic functions with some casual gaming.- Filled with many pre installed apps.- Don't expect too much with camera.- Sound is loud enough.- Charging take 90-120 mins.- Fingerprint sensor is less sensitive (my view)- Heats while charging and Gaming.I think purpose of this phone is for day to day calling with smartphone features of internet browsing, payments, YouTube, etc. It does well in that area.

It is good phone in this price range. It can do basic task with ease.- Build quality is good.- Phone screen is huge(I am not big fan of huge screens though).- Supports all basic functions with some casual gaming.- Filled with many pre installed apps.- Don't expect too much with camera.- Sound is loud enough.- Charging take 90-120 mins.- Fingerprint sensor is less sensitive (my view)- Heats while charging and Gaming.I think purpose of this phone is for day to day calling with smartphone features of internet browsing, payments, YouTube, etc. It does well in that area.

Okay for basic use, but it falls short in a few key areas. The charging speed is not as fast as expected, and the battery drains quicker than anticipated. The camera quality is average, not very impressive in low-light conditions. While performance is decent for casual usage, it lags during multitasking or when running heavier apps. Overall, it's good for light usage, but if you're looking for more efficiency, this may not be the best option.

Okay for basic use, but it falls short in a few key areas. The charging speed is not as fast as expected, and the battery drains quicker than anticipated. The camera quality is average, not very impressive in low-light conditions. While performance is decent for casual usage, it lags during multitasking or when running heavier apps. Overall, it's good for light usage, but if you're looking for more efficiency, this may not be the best option.

Good phone in this price
","
It is good phone in this price range. It can do basic task with ease.- Build quality is good.- Phone screen is huge(I am not big fan of huge screens though).- Supports all basic functions with some casual gaming.- Filled with many pre installed apps.- Don't expect too much with camera.- Sound is loud enough.- Charging take 90-120 mins.- Fingerprint sensor is less sensitive (my view)- Heats while charging and Gaming.I think purpose of this phone is for day to day calling with smartphone features of internet browsing, payments, YouTube, etc. It does well in that area.

Good phone at a reasonable price.
","
I was in search of a mobile phone for my parents and was initially hesitant to purchase this one, as I had no prior experience with the Narzo series. Despite my concerns, I decided to go ahead with the purchase because the price was reasonable, and the specifications seemed promising.After using the phone for a few days, I am pleased with my decision. The mobile not only looks sleek but is also comfortable to hold. It comes with the latest Android version, and the display quality is surprisingly good for a phone in this price range. The battery life is decent, lasting comfortably throughout the day with regular usage. The performance is smooth, with no noticeable lag while switching between apps or browsing. My parents also found it easy to use, which is a big plus.Overall, it's been a positive buying experience, and if you're looking for a reliable phone in the ‚Çπ10,000-‚Çπ11,000 range, I would definitely recommend giving this one a try. I'll be sure to update my review after a few months of usage to see how it holds up in the long run.

Great Performance & Camera for Everyday use

I needed a phone with good camera, good performance and strong 5G network connectivity within a small budget for my 19yo who is in college now.Not intended for Gaming so a lower RAM was ok.After going through several reviews this seemed to be a good phone that checked all the boxes. Incidentally had a Realme 1 for exchange and got good value for that as well.Package arrived in perfect shape and the delivery person was patient and courteous.Phone setup was smooth and have been using for 2 months now.Build quality 5/5 - phone feels premium like it is from a segment above. love the matte green colour and finishDisplay 4/5 quality is good for the price and its great phone for everyday use.5G Network connectivity 5/5 - top-notchPerformance 5/5 - fantastic for general tasks and doesnt lagAndroid 14 OS - 5/5 - out of the box android 14 - can expect two more version updatesBattery 5/5 - very efficient and easily lasts for two days for my usage.Icing on the cake was additional 6 months complimentary warranty from RealmeWill definitely recommend for someone looking for no-nonsense built-to-last budget phone for everyday use.Purchased from the seller Darshita Aashiyana.

After one month usage writing this review:1) Classic premium look.2) Camera is superb.3) The battery life is also good. As I am not much using phone, once the battery is charged, it works for at least 2 days which is really good thing.4) Processor is fine.5) Display and brightness is good.6) Speaker is quite loud which is a plus point.7) Many new features are added compared to Realme 2 (my previous phone).8) Overall very good performance.9) I got it @10900/ after all the discount and credit card cashback, i.e. I got almost 1600/- less (actual price was 12499).10) Just I found drawback is that it has no mira casting and fingerprint lock are given.Overall I will recommend this phone to all friends. Just go for it.

A decent purchase if buyed under 11k
","
There is a lot to talk . Keep this in mind that I purchased this phone only and only for normal use and casual gaming , normal photos . Let's come to first point the actual holding experience and design .However I was uncertain about that round camera shape , it always looked awkward to me but guess what ? It's not bad in a day or two your eyes will see get used to this new normal don't worry about that however the design is boxy and it's totally subjective to user I liked it .Let's come to display part , here comes the catch company never told you that it is a 720p display in branding etc only brags about 120 hz display and trust me it lacks that sharpness so be carefull about that even most phones around this range is now providing only hd/hd+ display so give it a though.Camera performance - didn't tested in low light but camera is just very normal, skin tone is actually good but don't expect anything like 22-25k phones , so they are just decent.Weight - I am constantly using a 30k+ phone compared to that it is good and feels light , watched a movie while traveling and it feels good but one thing is this I don't know that light things feels cheap üôÇ .Bloatware - god that same thing I am tired of seeing in budget phones . There are literally a lot and ruins the experience.Heating - normal heating on casual tasks and gaming but it's not like oh I can't hold It anymore but yeah it heats, not that much but I don't think will be the deal breaker .

The phone is alright except the following... The touchscreen is unusually unresponsive_ worse than even a cheaper phone, the sound output is awefu_ just like the ones from the unbranded Chinese phones of the 2007 or so. The 3 finger screenshot mode doesn't work properly either. 2 Sims can't be used, if one wishes to use a SD card as well. Auto brightness mode is also primitive! Overall not happy with it! I'm reviewing it after a week's use.The fingerprint scanner is also sub standard. Doesn't work most often!

I bought this phone for my wife but she became quite addicted to it. One night in a fit of anger, I slammed the phone against a concrete wall at least five times. I was certain it was completely destroyed. However after my anger subsided, I picked up the phone from the floor and to my astonishment. It was completely intact  just as it was before. Believe me it felt like a miracle... I still can't believe it but the phone is working perfectly and doesn‚Äôt even have a single scratch.

So using two mobiles with one sim in each is useful. 128gb + 256gb SD card. Sufficient space. No heating, hang issue. Sound is amply loud. I need not have to hear in full volume. Call sound great. Lightweight. Phone function is great. YouTube no issues. Internet smooth. A great phone for the price. Battery more than a day. Charging is also fast about an hour.

Good phone at a reasonable price.
","
I was in search of a mobile phone for my parents and was initially hesitant to purchase this one, as I had no prior experience with the Narzo series. Despite my concerns, I decided to go ahead with the purchase because the price was reasonable, and the specifications seemed promising.After using the phone for a few days, I am pleased with my decision. The mobile not only looks sleek but is also comfortable to hold. It comes with the latest Android version, and the display quality is surprisingly good for a phone in this price range. The battery life is decent, lasting comfortably throughout the day with regular usage. The performance is smooth, with no noticeable lag while switching between apps or browsing. My parents also found it easy to use, which is a big plus.Overall, it's been a positive buying experience, and if you're looking for a reliable phone in the ‚Çπ10,000-‚Çπ11,000 range, I would definitely recommend giving this one a try. I'll be sure to update my review after a few months of usage to see how it holds up in the long run.

Great Performance & Camera for Everyday use

I needed a phone with good camera, good performance and strong 5G network connectivity within a small budget for my 19yo who is in college now.Not intended for Gaming so a lower RAM was ok.After going through several reviews this seemed to be a good phone that checked all the boxes. Incidentally had a Realme 1 for exchange and got good value for that as well.Package arrived in perfect shape and the delivery person was patient and courteous.Phone setup was smooth and have been using for 2 months now.Build quality 5/5 - phone feels premium like it is from a segment above. love the matte green colour and finishDisplay 4/5 quality is good for the price and its great phone for everyday use.5G Network connectivity 5/5 - top-notchPerformance 5/5 - fantastic for general tasks and doesnt lagAndroid 14 OS - 5/5 - out of the box android 14 - can expect two more version updatesBattery 5/5 - very efficient and easily lasts for two days for my usage.Icing on the cake was additional 6 months complimentary warranty from RealmeWill definitely recommend for someone looking for no-nonsense built-to-last budget phone for everyday use.Purchased from the seller Darshita Aashiyana.

After one month usage writing this review:1) Classic premium look.2) Camera is superb.3) The battery life is also good. As I am not much using phone, once the battery is charged, it works for at least 2 days which is really good thing.4) Processor is fine.5) Display and brightness is good.6) Speaker is quite loud which is a plus point.7) Many new features are added compared to Realme 2 (my previous phone).8) Overall very good performance.9) I got it @10900/ after all the discount and credit card cashback, i.e. I got almost 1600/- less (actual price was 12499).10) Just I found drawback is that it has no mira casting and fingerprint lock are given.Overall I will recommend this phone to all friends. Just go for it.

A decent purchase if buyed under 11k
","
There is a lot to talk . Keep this in mind that I purchased this phone only and only for normal use and casual gaming , normal photos . Let's come to first point the actual holding experience and design .However I was uncertain about that round camera shape , it always looked awkward to me but guess what ? It's not bad in a day or two your eyes will see get used to this new normal don't worry about that however the design is boxy and it's totally subjective to user I liked it .Let's come to display part , here comes the catch company never told you that it is a 720p display in branding etc only brags about 120 hz display and trust me it lacks that sharpness so be carefull about that even most phones around this range is now providing only hd/hd+ display so give it a though.Camera performance - didn't tested in low light but camera is just very normal, skin tone is actually good but don't expect anything like 22-25k phones , so they are just decent.Weight - I am constantly using a 30k+ phone compared to that it is good and feels light , watched a movie while traveling and it feels good but one thing is this I don't know that light things feels cheap üôÇ .Bloatware - god that same thing I am tired of seeing in budget phones . There are literally a lot and ruins the experience.Heating - normal heating on casual tasks and gaming but it's not like oh I can't hold It anymore but yeah it heats, not that much but I don't think will be the deal breaker .

The phone is alright except the following... The touchscreen is unusually unresponsive_ worse than even a cheaper phone, the sound output is awefu_ just like the ones from the unbranded Chinese phones of the 2007 or so. The 3 finger screenshot mode doesn't work properly either. 2 Sims can't be used, if one wishes to use a SD card as well. Auto brightness mode is also primitive! Overall not happy with it! I'm reviewing it after a week's use.The fingerprint scanner is also sub standard. Doesn't work most often!

I bought this phone for my wife but she became quite addicted to it. One night in a fit of anger, I slammed the phone against a concrete wall at least five times. I was certain it was completely destroyed. However after my anger subsided, I picked up the phone from the floor and to my astonishment. It was completely intact  just as it was before. Believe me it felt like a miracle... I still can't believe it but the phone is working perfectly and doesn‚Äôt even have a single scratch.

Value for Money With Good Features but had a minor issue
","
I recently purchased the Redmi Note 13 5G, and overall, I am quite satisfied with the product, especially considering its price point. For a budget-friendly smartphone, it offers a reasonable level of performance. The 5G connectivity works well, and multitasking is quite smooth for day-to-day use. The display is crisp and vibrant, making watching videos and browsing a pleasant experience. The camera quality is decent for its price‚Äîboth the front and rear cameras deliver good shots in well-lit conditions.However, I did encounter a minor issue. After using the phone for about a week, it hung once, and I had to force restart it. Thankfully, it hasn‚Äôt happened again, but it‚Äôs something worth noting.Overall, for the price, this phone offers great value. Just be aware of the occasional glitch, but it shouldn't be a dealbreaker for most users.

Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ‚Çπ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features.It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time.Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later.  I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone.  I don't agree.  The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.I thought of displacing the phone.  There was no option of displacement in this.  There was an option to repair and damage.  Then I would apply.  Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it.  I rarely do that.  It is lying like that.  I will recommend the phone to you.  Don't buy this phone.  If you look at the brand.

The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.Hits:The resolution is goodNo heating issues with the batteryBattery life is goodCharge time is goodMisses:Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached)The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinchesDespite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button pressesA few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlockThe camera is average with washed out coloursWill add more later.Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can‚Äôt be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.

Average performance
","
I am writing this review after 2 months of usage. This is an average phone at this price tag. It is slower than  my earlier Redmi Y2 phone(6 years old) Camera is bad, as the autofocus doesn't respond properly. Macro photos are also not good, as the camera stability is not good. phone weight is higher due to built, which is not adding any benefit. Display is sharp n good but need to maximize it 100% under sunlight. Audio speaker is very directional, I need to adjust the holding conditions to hear from the earpiece. Please use it as a basic 5G smart phone with decent storage in average price. With loads of apps running on it, the phone doesn't lag. I like Mi phones due to their stable software and built quality but don't buy this one by watching Nora.. üòÑ

I used this mobile, past 30 days. It worth for money. There is no heating issue. Camera is ok.At the begining, battery drained fast.

Strongly recommend for this product.

All ia fine. But camera quality is really compromised. Photos are not as the real one, it has a yellowish layer which embarrassed me since i spent my13k into this. A mobile with 8k has good camera like redmi 7 note,  so why cant they afford to keep same standards even after having 2 back cameras. Disappointing for me.  Is there any chance of replacing this phone with another Redmi phone.

Nice mobileCamera: Average cameraBattery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark.

Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled rangeAudio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice.Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that.Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.

I ordered this phone for my daughter who is a student , basically for study related online classes. So not tested this for games etc but overall here is my feedback:Screen size is really large , good for taking online classes and good refresh rate. No pixel related issuesBattery back up is good, used this for entire day and still 40% of the battery is left.Look & feel is really great , with glass back, phone looks premium.Camera is good but not great. However good for capturing outdoor photography. I think with some camera updates, the quality should improvise.No memory issue related issues so far.Overall , a great value for money. This phone is good for all those who are in budget range (under 15k) and need a phone that looks premium, have good screen size & good battery.

Value for Money With Good Features but had a minor issue
","
I recently purchased the Redmi Note 13 5G, and overall, I am quite satisfied with the product, especially considering its price point. For a budget-friendly smartphone, it offers a reasonable level of performance. The 5G connectivity works well, and multitasking is quite smooth for day-to-day use. The display is crisp and vibrant, making watching videos and browsing a pleasant experience. The camera quality is decent for its price‚Äîboth the front and rear cameras deliver good shots in well-lit conditions.However, I did encounter a minor issue. After using the phone for about a week, it hung once, and I had to force restart it. Thankfully, it hasn‚Äôt happened again, but it‚Äôs something worth noting.Overall, for the price, this phone offers great value. Just be aware of the occasional glitch, but it shouldn't be a dealbreaker for most users.

When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day.First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ‚Çπ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features.It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time.Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later.  I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone.  I don't agree.  The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.I thought of displacing the phone.  There was no option of displacement in this.  There was an option to repair and damage.  Then I would apply.  Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it.  I rarely do that.  It is lying like that.  I will recommend the phone to you.  Don't buy this phone.  If you look at the brand.

The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.Hits:The resolution is goodNo heating issues with the batteryBattery life is goodCharge time is goodMisses:Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached)The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinchesDespite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button pressesA few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlockThe camera is average with washed out coloursWill add more later.Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can‚Äôt be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.

It is slower than  my earlier Redmi Y2 phone(6 years old) Camera is bad, as the autofocus doesn't respond properly. Macro photos are also not good, as the camera stability is not good. phone weight is higher due to built, which is not adding any benefit. Display is sharp n good but need to maximize it 100% under sunlight. Audio speaker is very directional, I need to adjust the holding conditions to hear from the earpiece. Please use it as a basic 5G smart phone with decent storage in average price. With loads of apps running on it, the phone doesn't lag. I like Mi phones due to their stable software and built quality but don't buy this one by watching Nora.. üòÑ

I used this mobile, past 30 days. It worth for money. There is no heating issue. Camera is ok.At the begining, battery drained fast. After one week, battery performance is improved, with one time charging enough for full day backup.Overall this price segment is worth for performance and camera, battery. Go for it. Strongly recommend for this product.

All ia fine. But camera quality is really compromised. Photos are not as the real one, it has a yellowish layer which embarrassed me since i spent my13k into this. A mobile with 8k has good camera like redmi 7 note,  so why cant they afford to keep same standards even after having 2 back cameras. Disappointing for me.  Is there any chance of replacing this phone with another Redmi phone.

Nice mobileCamera: Average cameraBattery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile.Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled rangeAudio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice.Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that.Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.

Value for Money With Good Features but had a minor issue
","
I recently purchased the Redmi Note 13 5G, and overall, I am quite satisfied with the product, especially considering its price point. For a budget-friendly smartphone, it offers a reasonable level of performance. The 5G connectivity works well, and multitasking is quite smooth for day-to-day use. The display is crisp and vibrant, making watching videos and browsing a pleasant experience. The camera quality is decent for its price‚Äîboth the front and rear cameras deliver good shots in well-lit conditions.However, I did encounter a minor issue. After using the phone for about a week, it hung once, and I had to force restart it. Thankfully, it hasn‚Äôt happened again, but it‚Äôs something worth noting.Overall, for the price, this phone offers great value. Just be aware of the occasional glitch, but it shouldn't be a dealbreaker for most users.

When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day.First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ‚Çπ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features.It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time.Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later.  I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone.  I don't agree.  The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.I thought of displacing the phone.  There was no option of displacement in this.  There was an option to repair and damage.  Then I would apply.  Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it.  I rarely do that.  It is lying like that.  I will recommend the phone to you.  Don't buy this phone.  If you look at the brand.

The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.Hits:The resolution is goodNo heating issues with the batteryBattery life is goodCharge time is goodMisses:Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached)The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinchesDespite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button pressesA few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlockThe camera is average with washed out coloursWill add more later.Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can‚Äôt be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.

","
All ia fine. But camera quality is really compromised. Photos are not as the real one, it has a yellowish layer which embarrassed me since i spent my13k into this. A mobile with 8k has good camera like redmi 7 note,  so why cant they afford to keep same standards even after having 2 back cameras. Disappointing for me.  Is there any chance of replacing this phone with another Redmi phone.

Nice mobileCamera: Average cameraBattery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile.Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled rangeAudio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice.Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that.Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.

Battery and Camera is not good
","
Bought it for12999.3 week usage review- Battery draining even in 4g signal- Even though it has 5030 mAh,  you will need to charge everyday with moderate usage.- Camera is not that great, pics look like taken in 10K mobiles- Color reproduction in the camera is bad- If you use camera for 15-20 min continuously, its heating up verymuch- Display is fine for the price, no lag when opening apps- Audio is okayOverall the price is not worth, it should have been placed at 10-11. As, we have better phones at 13-14.

I ordered this phone for my daughter who is a student , basically for study related online classes. So not tested this for games etc but overall here is my feedback:Screen size is really large , good for taking online classes and good refresh rate. No pixel related issuesBattery back up is good, used this for entire day and still 40% of the battery is left.Look & feel is really great , with glass back, phone looks premium.Camera is good but not great. However good for capturing outdoor photography. I think with some camera updates, the quality should improvise.No memory issue related issues so far.Overall , a great value for money. This phone is good for all those who are in budget range (under 15k) and need a phone that looks premium, have good screen size & good battery.

Value for Money With Good Features but had a minor issue
","
I recently purchased the Redmi Note 13 5G, and overall, I am quite satisfied with the product, especially considering its price point. For a budget-friendly smartphone, it offers a reasonable level of performance. The 5G connectivity works well, and multitasking is quite smooth for day-to-day use. The display is crisp and vibrant, making watching videos and browsing a pleasant experience. The camera quality is decent for its price‚Äîboth the front and rear cameras deliver good shots in well-lit conditions.However, I did encounter a minor issue. After using the phone for about a week, it hung once, and I had to force restart it. Thankfully, it hasn‚Äôt happened again, but it‚Äôs something worth noting.Overall, for the price, this phone offers great value. Just be aware of the occasional glitch, but it shouldn't be a dealbreaker for most users.

Speaker üîä Voice Is Very üòî Bad.
","
When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day.First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ‚Çπ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features.It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time.Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later.  I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone.  I don't agree.  The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.I thought of displacing the phone.  There was no option of displacement in this.  There was an option to repair and damage.  Then I would apply.  Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it.  I rarely do that.  It is lying like that.  I will recommend the phone to you.  Don't buy this phone.  If you look at the brand.

The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.Hits:The resolution is goodNo heating issues with the batteryBattery life is goodCharge time is goodMisses:Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached)The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinchesDespite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button pressesA few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlockThe camera is average with washed out coloursWill add more later.Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can‚Äôt be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.

I am writing this review after 2 months of usage. This is an average phone at this price tag. It is slower than  my earlier Redmi Y2 phone(6 years old) Camera is bad, as the autofocus doesn't respond properly. Macro photos are also not good, as the camera stability is not good. phone weight is higher due to built, which is not adding any benefit. Display is sharp n good but need to maximize it 100% under sunlight. Audio speaker is very directional, I need to adjust the holding conditions to hear from the earpiece. Please use it as a basic 5G smart phone with decent storage in average price. With loads of apps running on it, the phone doesn't lag. I like Mi phones due to their stable software and built quality but don't buy this one by watching Nora.. üòÑ

The phone has all functions related to android and Redmi series. It should automatically control memory fill up below 1.5 Gb. The whatsapp dual app did not open location map in this phone , Could not resolve .I then  made dual of maps app then it started. 5g capability could not be checked as service still not available.IT has C type pin as per govt regulations.

I ordered this phone for my daughter who is a student , basically for study related online classes. So not tested this for games etc but overall here is my feedback:Screen size is really large , good for taking online classes and good refresh rate. No pixel related issuesBattery back up is good, used this for entire day and still 40% of the battery is left.Look & feel is really great , with glass back, phone looks premium.Camera is good but not great. However good for capturing outdoor photography. I think with some camera updates, the quality should improvise.No memory issue related issues so far.Overall , a great value for money. This phone is good for all those who are in budget range (under 15k) and need a phone that looks premium, have good screen size & good battery.

Value for Money With Good Features but had a minor issue
","
I recently purchased the Redmi Note 13 5G, and overall, I am quite satisfied with the product, especially considering its price point. For a budget-friendly smartphone, it offers a reasonable level of performance. The 5G connectivity works well, and multitasking is quite smooth for day-to-day use. The display is crisp and vibrant, making watching videos and browsing a pleasant experience. The camera quality is decent for its price‚Äîboth the front and rear cameras deliver good shots in well-lit conditions.However, I did encounter a minor issue. After using the phone for about a week, it hung once, and I had to force restart it. Thankfully, it hasn‚Äôt happened again, but it‚Äôs something worth noting.Overall, for the price, this phone offers great value. Just be aware of the occasional glitch, but it shouldn't be a dealbreaker for most users.

Speaker üîä Voice Is Very üòî Bad.
","
When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day.First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ‚Çπ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features.It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time.Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later.  I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone.  I don't agree.  The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.I thought of displacing the phone.  There was no option of displacement in this.  There was an option to repair and damage.  Then I would apply.  Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it.  I rarely do that.  It is lying like that.  I will recommend the phone to you.  Don't buy this phone.  If you look at the brand.

The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.Hits:The resolution is goodNo heating issues with the batteryBattery life is goodCharge time is goodMisses:Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached)The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinchesDespite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button pressesA few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlockThe camera is average with washed out coloursWill add more later.Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can‚Äôt be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.

I am writing this review after 2 months of usage. This is an average phone at this price tag. It is slower than  my earlier Redmi Y2 phone(6 years old) Camera is bad, as the autofocus doesn't respond properly. Macro photos are also not good, as the camera stability is not good. phone weight is higher due to built, which is not adding any benefit. Display is sharp n good but need to maximize it 100% under sunlight. Audio speaker is very directional, I need to adjust the holding conditions to hear from the earpiece. Please use it as a basic 5G smart phone with decent storage in average price. With loads of apps running on it, the phone doesn't lag. I like Mi phones due to their stable software and built quality but don't buy this one by watching Nora.. üòÑ

As, we have better phones at 13-14.

I ordered this phone for my daughter who is a student , basically for study related online classes. So not tested this for games etc but overall here is my feedback:Screen size is really large , good for taking online classes and good refresh rate. No pixel related issuesBattery back up is good, used this for entire day and still 40% of the battery is left.Look & feel is really great , with glass back, phone looks premium.Camera is good but not great. However good for capturing outdoor photography. I think with some camera updates, the quality should improvise.No memory issue related issues so far.Overall , a great value for money. This phone is good for all those who are in budget range (under 15k) and need a phone that looks premium, have good screen size & good battery.

Value for Money With Good Features but had a minor issue
","
I recently purchased the Redmi Note 13 5G, and overall, I am quite satisfied with the product, especially considering its price point. For a budget-friendly smartphone, it offers a reasonable level of performance. The 5G connectivity works well, and multitasking is quite smooth for day-to-day use. The display is crisp and vibrant, making watching videos and browsing a pleasant experience. The camera quality is decent for its price‚Äîboth the front and rear cameras deliver good shots in well-lit conditions.However, I did encounter a minor issue. After using the phone for about a week, it hung once, and I had to force restart it. Thankfully, it hasn‚Äôt happened again, but it‚Äôs something worth noting.Overall, for the price, this phone offers great value. Just be aware of the occasional glitch, but it shouldn't be a dealbreaker for most users.

When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day.First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ‚Çπ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features.It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time.Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later.  I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone.  I don't agree.  The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.I thought of displacing the phone.  There was no option of displacement in this.  There was an option to repair and damage.  Then I would apply.  Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it.  I rarely do that.  It is lying like that.  I will recommend the phone to you.  Don't buy this phone.  If you look at the brand.

The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.Hits:The resolution is goodNo heating issues with the batteryBattery life is goodCharge time is goodMisses:Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached)The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinchesDespite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button pressesA few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlockThe camera is average with washed out coloursWill add more later.Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can‚Äôt be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.

Average performance
","
I am writing this review after 2 months of usage. This is an average phone at this price tag. It is slower than  my earlier Redmi Y2 phone(6 years old) Camera is bad, as the autofocus doesn't respond properly. Macro photos are also not good, as the camera stability is not good. phone weight is higher due to built, which is not adding any benefit. Display is sharp n good but need to maximize it 100% under sunlight. Audio speaker is very directional, I need to adjust the holding conditions to hear from the earpiece. Please use it as a basic 5G smart phone with decent storage in average price. With loads of apps running on it, the phone doesn't lag. I like Mi phones due to their stable software and built quality but don't buy this one by watching Nora.. üòÑ

I used this mobile, past 30 days. It worth for money. There is no heating issue. Camera is ok.At the begining, battery drained fast. After one week, battery performance is improved, with one time charging enough for full day backup.Overall this price segment is worth for performance and camera, battery. Go for it. Strongly recommend for this product.

Phone is too long and heavy to hold. Hand gets painful. Will take time getting used to this. Sound is a disappointment. Volume become low automatically when watching certain clips on Twitter.

All ia fine. But camera quality is really compromised. Photos are not as the real one, it has a yellowish layer which embarrassed me since i spent my13k into this. A mobile with 8k has good camera like redmi 7 note,  so why cant they afford to keep same standards even after having 2 back cameras. Disappointing for me.  Is there any chance of replacing this phone with another Redmi phone.

Nice mobileCamera: Average cameraBattery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile.Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled rangeAudio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice.Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that.Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.

As, we have better phones at 13-14.

I ordered this phone for my daughter who is a student , basically for study related online classes. So not tested this for games etc but overall here is my feedback:Screen size is really large , good for taking online classes and good refresh rate. No pixel related issuesBattery back up is good, used this for entire day and still 40% of the battery is left.Look & feel is really great , with glass back, phone looks premium.Camera is good but not great. However good for capturing outdoor photography. I think with some camera updates, the quality should improvise.No memory issue related issues so far.Overall , a great value for money. This phone is good for all those who are in budget range (under 15k) and need a phone that looks premium, have good screen size & good battery.

Value for Money With Good Features but had a minor issue
","
I recently purchased the Redmi Note 13 5G, and overall, I am quite satisfied with the product, especially considering its price point. For a budget-friendly smartphone, it offers a reasonable level of performance. The 5G connectivity works well, and multitasking is quite smooth for day-to-day use. The display is crisp and vibrant, making watching videos and browsing a pleasant experience. The camera quality is decent for its price‚Äîboth the front and rear cameras deliver good shots in well-lit conditions.However, I did encounter a minor issue. After using the phone for about a week, it hung once, and I had to force restart it. Thankfully, it hasn‚Äôt happened again, but it‚Äôs something worth noting.Overall, for the price, this phone offers great value. Just be aware of the occasional glitch, but it shouldn't be a dealbreaker for most users.

When this phone was launched on 12th September, I bought this phone on the same day.First time on a fixed date from Amazon, I was very happy that this phone was very good. Its speaker quality, video etc. will be very good and this phone cost me ‚Çπ 13000. If we look at the friend inside it then according to it the respect is very good like Motorola Motorola gives very good features.It's fine and it doesn't have unnecessary buttons etc. and that's why it is easy to use and its speaker quality is very good, so I ordered this phone at this time.Okay, so when I ordered this phone, it was delivered here in 2 days and 3 days later.  I brought the phone but when I played a song in this phone, its audio quality appeared to be of very poor type, which is worse than the old Mi phones, we got to see its voice quality even worse, so I saw it in this phone.  I don't agree.  The quality of this phone is very bad, I had applied for it.I thought of displacing the phone.  There was no option of displacement in this.  There was an option to repair and damage.  Then I would apply.  Then if we see this phone coming, then what is the benefit for us in this, it would be a waste of our time, so I kept this phone for every mother and I use it.  I rarely do that.  It is lying like that.  I will recommend the phone to you.  Don't buy this phone.  If you look at the brand.

The product is good. Haven't used it much to share how it works but so far so good. The package was well cushioned and the delivery was impeccable. The delivery executive was polite and professional.While buying the phone, I chose to exchange my old Xiaomi Note 8 (5 year old) and the site showed the exchange value as 3800 (199 exchange charge extra). When the phone was assessed at the spot, owing to a small dent on the side, the exchange value was knocked down by 60%!! Mind you, the screen had no scratches or dead pixels, both front and back glass was intact, the phone was working but my, oh my.This is pure mis-selling since they need to phone to be ABSOLUTELY new to give you just 40% of the buy price.Update 1: Been using the phone for a few days and there are a few hits and misses.Hits:The resolution is goodNo heating issues with the batteryBattery life is goodCharge time is goodMisses:Despite a 120Hz refresh rate, the screen is laggy and sticks (video attached)The touch is sticky and results in unexpected lags/pinchesDespite pocket mode activated, the phone screen comes on resulting in unexpected button pressesA few apps like Amazon, Phonepe take a while to load, unlockThe camera is average with washed out coloursWill add more later.Update 2: Touch issues are really bad with double tap, mis-tap happening one too many times. Another issue I noticed was that the ringtone can‚Äôt be changed. Looks more like a software glitch.

I am writing this review after 2 months of usage. This is an average phone at this price tag. It is slower than  my earlier Redmi Y2 phone(6 years old) Camera is bad, as the autofocus doesn't respond properly. Macro photos are also not good, as the camera stability is not good. phone weight is higher due to built, which is not adding any benefit. Display is sharp n good but need to maximize it 100% under sunlight. Audio speaker is very directional, I need to adjust the holding conditions to hear from the earpiece. Please use it as a basic 5G smart phone with decent storage in average price. With loads of apps running on it, the phone doesn't lag. I like Mi phones due to their stable software and built quality but don't buy this one by watching Nora.. üòÑ

All ia fine. But camera quality is really compromised. Photos are not as the real one, it has a yellowish layer which embarrassed me since i spent my13k into this. A mobile with 8k has good camera like redmi 7 note,  so why cant they afford to keep same standards even after having 2 back cameras. Disappointing for me.  Is there any chance of replacing this phone with another Redmi phone.

Nice mobileCamera: Average cameraBattery life: Battery life of this mobile is not upto the mark. It is a 5000 MAH battery but while using u feel that you are using 4500 MAH battery mobile.Display: I think display is best in this price range. The adoptive refresh works well. The max refresh rate. Is 120 and it is good in this segment. It is FHD+ display but it looks like Amoled display. Almost the display quality equals Amoled rangeAudio: This is a single speaker and the audio quality is decent. Some other brands offer dual speaker in this price range but it is offering single speaker only. Call quality is nice.Camera: Average camera. I don't use camera much so I don't have problem with that.Overall it is a nice mobile in this price range.

I ordered this phone for my daughter who is a student , basically for study related online classes. So not tested this for games etc but overall here is my feedback:Screen size is really large , good for taking online classes and good refresh rate. No pixel related issuesBattery back up is good, used this for entire day and still 40% of the battery is left.Look & feel is really great , with glass back, phone looks premium.Camera is good but not great. However good for capturing outdoor photography. I think with some camera updates, the quality should improvise.No memory issue related issues so far.Overall , a great value for money. This phone is good for all those who are in budget range (under 15k) and need a phone that looks premium, have good screen size & good battery.

Best budget phone with decent features..
","
Replaced my 5 yrs old Redmi Note 7 pro (6+128gb) with 4+128 version of 13c 5G. The Redmi note 7 pro had costed me 14k and I got 2.8k under exchange plus another 300 as cashback so this 13c costed me effectively 5.9k only. And I Must say for this given price, the phone has not disappointed at all thus far. UI Experience is same and as good as my earlier phone (which I was habitual of), thus was a smooth experience to transition to the new device. Screen quality is super awesome, Camera is just okaish (Below par for a 50MP lens - but you can't ask for an iphone pro max quality at this price), battery is lasting more than 1.5-2 days on a full charge and normal usage as I am not into gaming or other heavy usage. The only con is it takes a good duration of time to charge up. I am using an 18w charger (recommended higher limit) and it takes about 3-4 hrs at min to charge it fully. (Users tend to make a mistake by using higher than recommended chargers in order to charge fast and thus end up damaging their Phones ICs). The charger provided along with the box is standard 10w charger which is useless and I am not using anyways. On the storage, I feel128 gb is more than enough as it was same in my old phone and after using it for 5 years I could use only 90gb of it. For the RAM, again I felt 4 gb should be more than enough as previous 6gb version always showed idle RAM capacity of 3.5-4 GB. And using it till now have not felt any lag or so in normal operations. No heating issues as such. Sound quality is fine. If you are a normal/conservative smartphone user, this is the Best phone you will find under this budget. Even if it lasts another 4-5 years, :) , it would be a complete Paisa vasool. Let's hope it does last that long. And this is also to set an example in an era where people are going crazy/gungho about phones exceeding 1.5lacs with blah blah features, that, if used properly, even a 6k smartphone can serve you equally well ;)

Performance:Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ 5G chipset, the phone offers adequate performance for casual use, browsing, social media, and moderate gaming. While it‚Äôs not a flagship-level processor, it handles daily tasks smoothly, especially with 4GB of RAM. However, for heavy multitasking or intensive gaming, users might experience some lag.Storage:With 128GB of storage, there‚Äôs plenty of room for apps, photos, videos, and other media. This amount of storage is generous for a phone at this price point, especially with the option to expand it via a microSD card.5G Connectivity:The inclusion of 5G is a standout feature, future-proofing the device for faster mobile internet speeds, making it a great option for those looking for an affordable entry into the 5G ecosystem.Battery & Charging:Although the battery details aren‚Äôt mentioned here, Redmi phones typically feature solid battery life. You can expect a full day‚Äôs use on a single charge, especially with power-efficient 5G chips like the Dimensity 6100+.Overall:The Redmi 13C 5G is a good choice for budget-conscious consumers who want 5G connectivity, a smooth 90Hz display, and ample storage. Its performance is decent for everyday use, though heavy users may feel limited by the 4GB RAM. If you‚Äôre looking for an affordable 5G smartphone that doesn‚Äôt compromise too much on features, this model is worth considering.

The Redmi 13C is an impressive budget 5G phone with a sleek design that feels premium for its price range. The performance is solid, daily tasks are handled smoothly, and the display is bright and vibrant. However, the speaker quality is disappointing; low volume and muffled sound diminishes the overall experience.

Best budget phone with decent features..
","
Replaced my 5 yrs old Redmi Note 7 pro (6+128gb) with 4+128 version of 13c 5G. The Redmi note 7 pro had costed me 14k and I got 2.8k under exchange plus another 300 as cashback so this 13c costed me effectively 5.9k only. And I Must say for this given price, the phone has not disappointed at all thus far. UI Experience is same and as good as my earlier phone (which I was habitual of), thus was a smooth experience to transition to the new device. Screen quality is super awesome, Camera is just okaish (Below par for a 50MP lens - but you can't ask for an iphone pro max quality at this price), battery is lasting more than 1.5-2 days on a full charge and normal usage as I am not into gaming or other heavy usage. The only con is it takes a good duration of time to charge up. I am using an 18w charger (recommended higher limit) and it takes about 3-4 hrs at min to charge it fully. (Users tend to make a mistake by using higher than recommended chargers in order to charge fast and thus end up damaging their Phones ICs). The charger provided along with the box is standard 10w charger which is useless and I am not using anyways. On the storage, I feel128 gb is more than enough as it was same in my old phone and after using it for 5 years I could use only 90gb of it. For the RAM, again I felt 4 gb should be more than enough as previous 6gb version always showed idle RAM capacity of 3.5-4 GB. And using it till now have not felt any lag or so in normal operations. No heating issues as such. Sound quality is fine. If you are a normal/conservative smartphone user, this is the Best phone you will find under this budget. Even if it lasts another 4-5 years, :) , it would be a complete Paisa vasool. Let's hope it does last that long. And this is also to set an example in an era where people are going crazy/gungho about phones exceeding 1.5lacs with blah blah features, that, if used properly, even a 6k smartphone can serve you equally well ;)

Decent Budget Phone, But 4 GB RAM Falls Short for Heavy Users
","
**Pros:**- Affordable price for the specs and features offered.- Ideal for lighter users, like parents, who don't use their phones heavily.- Front camera quality is surprisingly better than the rear camera.- Phone size and design match the description provided.**Cons:**- 4 GB of RAM feels insufficient for multitasking and heavier usage.- Installed 60 apps; frequently used 20-25 apps, and occasionally used 10-15, but still experienced issues with app refreshing when switching between them.- Lost progress in apps like Chrome, Prime Video, and Telegram due to background refresh.- The 6 GB variant would have been a better choice, though slightly over budget.- The phone feels large in hand, which might not be comfortable for everyone.

Performance:Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ 5G chipset, the phone offers adequate performance for casual use, browsing, social media, and moderate gaming. While it‚Äôs not a flagship-level processor, it handles daily tasks smoothly, especially with 4GB of RAM. However, for heavy multitasking or intensive gaming, users might experience some lag.Storage:With 128GB of storage, there‚Äôs plenty of room for apps, photos, videos, and other media. This amount of storage is generous for a phone at this price point, especially with the option to expand it via a microSD card.5G Connectivity:The inclusion of 5G is a standout feature, future-proofing the device for faster mobile internet speeds, making it a great option for those looking for an affordable entry into the 5G ecosystem.Battery & Charging:Although the battery details aren‚Äôt mentioned here, Redmi phones typically feature solid battery life. You can expect a full day‚Äôs use on a single charge, especially with power-efficient 5G chips like the Dimensity 6100+.Overall:The Redmi 13C 5G is a good choice for budget-conscious consumers who want 5G connectivity, a smooth 90Hz display, and ample storage. Its performance is decent for everyday use, though heavy users may feel limited by the 4GB RAM. If you‚Äôre looking for an affordable 5G smartphone that doesn‚Äôt compromise too much on features, this model is worth considering.

I liked most of the things as i have been using redmi smartphones from quite long time.The only drawback which i felt biggest one is speaker.I ordered it for my mother and the hands free speaker is very low (not audible even in quiet places) which makes it difficult to use for anyone.I wish i could have returned but since i had no option so went with the phone. Apart from this no issues so far.

The Redmi 13C is an impressive budget 5G phone with a sleek design that feels premium for its price range. The performance is solid, daily tasks are handled smoothly, and the display is bright and vibrant. However, the speaker quality is disappointing; low volume and muffled sound diminishes the overall experience. If audio quality isn't your top priority, it's still a good option for its price, especially with 5G connectivity.

Best budget phone with decent features..
","
Replaced my 5 yrs old Redmi Note 7 pro (6+128gb) with 4+128 version of 13c 5G. The Redmi note 7 pro had costed me 14k and I got 2.8k under exchange plus another 300 as cashback so this 13c costed me effectively 5.9k only. And I Must say for this given price, the phone has not disappointed at all thus far. UI Experience is same and as good as my earlier phone (which I was habitual of), thus was a smooth experience to transition to the new device. Screen quality is super awesome, Camera is just okaish (Below par for a 50MP lens - but you can't ask for an iphone pro max quality at this price), battery is lasting more than 1.5-2 days on a full charge and normal usage as I am not into gaming or other heavy usage. The only con is it takes a good duration of time to charge up. I am using an 18w charger (recommended higher limit) and it takes about 3-4 hrs at min to charge it fully. (Users tend to make a mistake by using higher than recommended chargers in order to charge fast and thus end up damaging their Phones ICs). The charger provided along with the box is standard 10w charger which is useless and I am not using anyways. On the storage, I feel128 gb is more than enough as it was same in my old phone and after using it for 5 years I could use only 90gb of it. For the RAM, again I felt 4 gb should be more than enough as previous 6gb version always showed idle RAM capacity of 3.5-4 GB. And using it till now have not felt any lag or so in normal operations. No heating issues as such. Sound quality is fine. If you are a normal/conservative smartphone user, this is the Best phone you will find under this budget. Even if it lasts another 4-5 years, :) , it would be a complete Paisa vasool. Let's hope it does last that long. And this is also to set an example in an era where people are going crazy/gungho about phones exceeding 1.5lacs with blah blah features, that, if used properly, even a 6k smartphone can serve you equally well ;)

Decent Budget Phone, But 4 GB RAM Falls Short for Heavy Users
","
**Pros:**- Affordable price for the specs and features offered.- Ideal for lighter users, like parents, who don't use their phones heavily.- Front camera quality is surprisingly better than the rear camera.- Phone size and design match the description provided.**Cons:**- 4 GB of RAM feels insufficient for multitasking and heavier usage.- Installed 60 apps; frequently used 20-25 apps, and occasionally used 10-15, but still experienced issues with app refreshing when switching between them.- Lost progress in apps like Chrome, Prime Video, and Telegram due to background refresh.- The 6 GB variant would have been a better choice, though slightly over budget.- The phone feels large in hand, which might not be comfortable for everyone.

Performance:Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ 5G chipset, the phone offers adequate performance for casual use, browsing, social media, and moderate gaming. While it‚Äôs not a flagship-level processor, it handles daily tasks smoothly, especially with 4GB of RAM. However, for heavy multitasking or intensive gaming, users might experience some lag.Storage:With 128GB of storage, there‚Äôs plenty of room for apps, photos, videos, and other media. This amount of storage is generous for a phone at this price point, especially with the option to expand it via a microSD card.5G Connectivity:The inclusion of 5G is a standout feature, future-proofing the device for faster mobile internet speeds, making it a great option for those looking for an affordable entry into the 5G ecosystem.Battery & Charging:Although the battery details aren‚Äôt mentioned here, Redmi phones typically feature solid battery life. You can expect a full day‚Äôs use on a single charge, especially with power-efficient 5G chips like the Dimensity 6100+.Overall:The Redmi 13C 5G is a good choice for budget-conscious consumers who want 5G connectivity, a smooth 90Hz display, and ample storage. Its performance is decent for everyday use, though heavy users may feel limited by the 4GB RAM. If you‚Äôre looking for an affordable 5G smartphone that doesn‚Äôt compromise too much on features, this model is worth considering.

I liked most of the things as i have been using redmi smartphones from quite long time.The only drawback which i felt biggest one is speaker.I ordered it for my mother and the hands free speaker is very low (not audible even in quiet places) which makes it difficult to use for anyone.I wish i could have returned but since i had no option so went with the phone. Apart from this no issues so far.

The Redmi 13C is an impressive budget 5G phone with a sleek design that feels premium for its price range. The performance is solid, daily tasks are handled smoothly, and the display is bright and vibrant. However, the speaker quality is disappointing; low volume and muffled sound diminishes the overall experience. If audio quality isn't your top priority, it's still a good option for its price, especially with 5G connectivity.

Not for Everyone
","
I'm leaving a 5* here just because this phone is close to perfect for me. Do not expect wonders if you are planning to buy this phone. As the headline suggests, it is not for everyone.1. The build quality is good and the weight feels perfect as it is not on the heavier side. Since the weight distribution is good, it's easy to handle with one hand despite the screen size being close to ""massive"".2. The AMOLED screen works it's magic while watching videos. My primary aim to buy this phone was for viewing purpose since I spend a lot of time on YouTube and other streaming platforms. The color distribution is a chef's kiss since it does not try to forcibly add gradients. More on the natural side and hence the viewing experience will feel pleasant.3. Sound could have been better. The mono speakers feels cheap but yet surprisingly does the job. I use speakers and headphones so that it's that big of an issue for me (but if you depend on phone speakers for your entertainment, better look for another phone possibly POCO for stereo speakers at the same price point but then you will miss out on the display part )4. CHARGING ISSUE? The answer is NO, Although it's been just a day using this phone, i did not face any issues. I was skeptical after reading the reviews about the charging issues. It's true that I faced a little hiccup when i first charged the phone right after unboxing where the connection is interrupted during charger but that was just for a few seconds (Give it some time and the charging connection issue will disappear). Further the Hyper OS update completely rectified the issue.5. Refresh rate at 120Hz noticeably improves the social media experience. Brightness is good and you won't have any issues using the phone in sunlight. Switch to optimal settings for better using experience6. 5G works like a charm for me with JIO giving speeds of over 250 Mbps most of the time (Depends on the 5G zones. Some of you might get even better since stay near the outskirts of the city)7. Gaming: Not yet tested but it doesn't matter a lot to me so that's fine.8. Camera : Low light photos are good but make sure to stabilize your hand or else it would be blurry. 108 MP camera photos are good and provide good detailing. It could definitely have been a lot better but this phone is not for camera enthusiasts. If you like to create memories by clicking photos and not fuss about the details about them you can definitely go for it.Overall do not exclude this phone from your options (if you are planning on buying this) just by reading the negative reviews. I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews. People should update their phones to the latest firmware to bring out the best and eliminate any bugs.

The Redmi Note 13 5G unfortunately suffers from poor battery performance, which can be a dealbreaker for many users. Despite this major drawback, the phone excels in several areas.Its performance is commendable, handling multitasking and gaming smoothly without lag. The build quality is solid, giving it a premium feel that rivals more expensive models. The display quality is impressive, featuring vibrant colors and sharp details, making it great for media consumption. The screen size is generous, providing an immersive experience for watching videos and browsing.Overall, while the Redmi Note 13 5G offers great speed and quality, the subpar battery life significantly detracts from its appeal. SO I REQUEST EVERY BUYER IF YOU ARE USING MOBILE FOR A LONG TIME I WILL NOT SUGGEST THIS MOBILE AS A FRIEND/ WELL WISHER I AM SAYING THIS THANKYOU FOR EVERYONE FOR READING THIS REAL REVIEW.

The Redmi Note 13 Pro offers great value for its price, featuring a sleek design, a vibrant 6.67-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate, and solid performance powered by a Snapdragon 7 series processor. Its 5000mAh battery with 67W fast charging is excellent, and the 200MP main camera performs well in good lighting, though low-light results are average. MIUI software is feature-rich but may feel cluttered. Overall, it's a reliable mid-range option for everyday use, though power users might find some limitations in performance and camera quality.

I'm satisfied with the performance of the phone after using it for more than one week. Battery backup is decent. Need to charge it once a day. Fast charging is pretty good with 67W charger. Camera quality is okay. 200 MP is not so good. Giving decent photo output. Speaker sound quality is top notch with Dolby surround sound. 3.5 mm jack gives good output with earbuds. Weight of the phone os light. In device fingerprint sensor is cool. Highly recommended for budget conscious customers.

My honest reply after using about a month
","
Guys it's actually the best phone after getting hyper os in this device...1.Camera is absolutely great with no lag at all... Captures very fast and also the 200 MP gives much details and also giving natural colors... Video is the good at 4k 30fps and it's best at 1080 60 fps at both back and front... It's like xiaomi's flagship camera management which also gives better night photography... Totally I loved this camera‚ù§2. Performance is better than other phones in this segment... As it's 7s Gen 2 but better than 7 gen 3 used in oneplus and motorolla with less heating and no lag for long game sessions like bgmi or free fire or call of duty mobile.... Can be played with smooth 60 fps and hdr 40fps which feels like butter in bgmi! But does not overheat...3. Battery health is well optimised it will go around whole day easily with normal social media user.... If gaming is there then 7 to 10 hours.... Charging is very fast!!4. The build quality is premium which gorilla Glass victus and light weight and display is flagship level... Which u can see movies or series which is very awesome...Overall this phone is better than oneplus or samsung as oneplus overheats and samsung camera is becoming poor... Don't get feel bad for reading bad reviews... Try this on urself if u don't like it although u can return it within 7 days.... Hope this help u guys...VALUE FOR MONEY...

Well it's about one week am using this phone. Few points which might help others who are looking to buy this phone1.looks wise it gives premium style. No issues on that. touch & speed is good. Once you get the phone you will get an immediate update which just slightly enhances features from androd 142.Camera quality is good. At this price range certainly one of the best cameras  . Pictures look quite natural. Particularly liked the night mode quality.3.battery charging is indeed rapid. Gives 100 percent charge in 1 hour. My only problem is that if we don't use battery saver then battery gets discharged in 6 hours even with moderate usage. Needs to charge a twice a day4.there is no lag as of now. Speed is fast and smooth. Over all a value for money in 22-23k budget..

","
Battery - Even though this phone has decent specs, this is not a gaming phone/or a phone for heavy usages imo. The main reason is battery backup, it's below par. Even though the device comes with 5100 mAh battery, battery backup is poor.Camera - Decent, does the job. Takes good photos in low-light conditions too. But I noticed a bug in the camera, whenever camera is opened, the exposure is too high for a 1-2 sec, only after that the camera adjusts to surrounding. This problem was not seen in other camera( When accessed through WhatsApp, or Instagram). So I believe it's something for the backend team of MI to fix.Display - Decent. Nothing much to complain. So far so good.NB : Hyper OS needs to be optimised. Because right now there are lot of bugs in the OS.Overall a 8/10. If you're looking for a device for day to day activities, this phone is more than enough. Stay away if you're a gamer or someone who's work depends a lot on mobile.Thanks.

Battery backup not satisfactory...
","
I been using Mi phones since 2016. Compared to those which I used, 13note pro battery backup is comparatively bad. I purchased 2 number of note 13pro on se day. I am facing battery backup issue on both. Hope this isses will be addressed and resolved with coming updates.Display and Sound quality is wonderful.

good phone.. but be careful with delivery agents if you are exchanging old phone.
","
Good phone. No issues with that.But if you are exhanging your old phone, you have to be little more careful.Dont handover your old phone straight away to the delivery guy, its better you get the otp required for the rabbit exchage app tests, from him and YOU RUN THE TESTS BY YOURSELF While having the agent nearby,..It seems some delivery agents wanted to reduce the attractive exchange prices thats declared during the time of order ( may be instructed by their lead)In my case: Handed the old phone straight away to the delivery agent, and after FEW minutes, he tried to create artificial panic by saying imei not found (invalid)and he started his bargain saying it could be stolen and created panics to the resident. Luckily i had the puchase bill(from a reputed offline store, where we used to buy highend phones). Same time i asked the resident to do a factory reset again and yes the imei was displaying after that.,I felt something fishyMy question:1. How did the imei ( which i used for registering exchange)got invalid after he received the phone.2. why didnt the delivery guy(or his team which he spoke to by call) suggest a solution (in my case:another factory reset) instead he tried to create artificial panic and started his bargain.( May be they have some technique to make it invalid , create panic, then pay extra)Anyways his behavior was not of a honest one. So guys if you exchange , do the tests yourself with the agent nearby., its not a rocket science, just an user freindly app.Note:My bad, I paid rs.3480extra through gpay, as my resident accidently dropped the phone while handing over due to which the display glass was cracked.This happened after the IMEI dramas, as explained above.The above mentioned amount was declared by the agent all of a sudden, i dont know from where he got that value., i asked him does the app was showing that value, for which he replied, if we go through the app, the amount to pay will be more only. The total scenario was fishy.Good phone , Good platform, fishy delivery n exchange service

It looks splendid, simply love the scarlet red, works fine. I have been using a Xiaomi device for a long time, so am used to the UI.

A Powerhouse of a Phone - Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus Review
","
I've been using the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus for a week now, and I must say, it's exceeded my expectations in almost every department! The phone's performance is lightning-fast, thanks to the powerful processor and ample RAM. The display is stunning, with vibrant colors and crisp visuals. Battery life is impressive, easily lasting a day with heavy usage. Cameras are top-notch, capturing detailed photos and videos. The design is sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. Call quality is top notch, even in low network areas.Cons: software and security update as given are for 03 years and 04 years respectively, they could have offered for more like for 05 years, though the phone came with Hyper OS and Android 14 out of th the box, comparing to the initial phone which came with MIUI 14 and Android 13. It will be a long wait to see how many updates i will be getting.Other only minor gripe is the lack of wireless charging, but that's a small trade-off for the incredible value this phone offers. Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying my Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus experience and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a high-performance device without breaking the bank. My review - A premium package on a mid range budget.

Good product

First of all let's go with the prosDisplay: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from  about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well‚Ä¢ some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins‚Ä¢ I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good‚Ä¢ And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperosAnd the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found‚Ä¢ and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smoothCons:I think this stuff is a bit overpricedThe camera is not up to the mark in these price rangeBut still it can be fixed with a software updateAnd the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 minsAnd the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank youüòä

Noteworthy!
","
I've been using the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ for a while now, and I have to say, it's an amazing phone, especially for the price. Here‚Äôs why I love it:Design and Feel:First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.Display:The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.Performance:Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I‚Äôve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.Camera:The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It‚Äôs perfect for snapping great photos on the go.Battery Life:Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you‚Äôre in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!Software:HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you‚Äôre coming from another brand, but it‚Äôs intuitive and has a lot of useful features.Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!

As an Xiaomi user for many years , i have purchased this phone on 31 may 2024, initially i loved the phone the looks the performance and also it's offers the ip68(IP68 is an international standard rating for the protection of electrical enclosures against dust and water. The rating is made up of two numbers, with the first number indicating protection against solids and the second number indicating protection against water. In the case of IP68, the numbers are:6Total protection against solid ingress, including small dust particles like sand and dirt8Total protection against water ingress, including complete submersion for more than 30 minutes below one meter)Water spills on my phone and gets inside the phone which effects the fingerprint sensor , cellular network not working also the charging not working and primary mic stopped working after such issues i visited near mi care to resolve the issue, firstly the decline the warrenty as the water damage is there but i asked them this phone comes with ip68 ,the said and show the inside indicator for water is red so your warrenty is voided ,and the said your phone has many damages internally so after the inspection they said you have to pay 10000rs for the replacement of parts which is 1/3cost of the smartphone.....I asked Xiaomi is this is ip68 ??I asked Xiaomi is this is your service for many year user?I have been using mi smartphone from redmi 1s till nowI asked Xiaomi this is good experience for any user as he purchased a brand new phone and this happens??

Battery backup is not upto the mark. It charges fast which is a good point but drains fast as well. Camera quality is not what you expect with 200MP camera.

Attention buyers of this phone, I have been using it for 5 days, display quality is very very good, fast charging is good, but camera quality is very very bad.  I was using xiaomi 11 lite NE 5g and its camera was 60 mp.  This 200 mp camera does not even get 25% of the quality of the photo taken by that camera.  Photos taken on xiaomi backed up to this phone lose 50% quality when opened on this phone.  Those who are interested in buying this phone after looking at the camera quality should look at other phones.

Well kudos to Amazon for delivering this fast.The phone itself is""simple""  yet has a gorgeous DCI P3 std display with wide color gamut.  Video diaply is amazing. perfect for watching movies etc.Bit heavy it does fit snugly in your hands. Out of the box synicing to the old phone and getting started to use your new phone is easy. I noticed minor lag on apps like YT however this was solved as soon as I updated the preinstalled apps. audio quality through stereo speakers is top notch.NOW the bad part of this phone is its camera department.. 200 MP is just a silly moniker.. the phone software seems to be over correcting edges around faces. portrait seem ""watery"" as from an old 90s phone  with lack of detail and texture.. on the plus side the macro camera is ok. Same story with the portrait mode.The AI in the camera doesn't show the scene detected eg food,  flowers, etc which is sad .. as you don't know what algorithm is been applied,Skin textures often seem to be blown out or phone seems to apply over smoothing in some places.  HDR mode blows out photos in bright highlights. Honestly not a  delight to use camera.The phone itself is blazing fast. and not much bloatware . Excellent for using office apps . I miss the quickball to take screenshots. and camera portions are prone to smudges or finger prints. Wish they had a more textured matte blacScreen k version.Advice... avoid if you want a good camera .. buy if you want second space feature and multi app support with powerful processing for office related apps amd occasional gamingI

I'm completely satisfied with the phone and I thought this could be of help to someone looking for a phone just like I did. Battery back up as of now is about a day and half with decent usage. This limited edition looks cool.

I bought a new redmi note 13 pro plus phone. After few days, it became un-responsive. Battery issue, it was getting restarted automatically. After service center visit, they found the motherboard of this phone is faulty. They are fixing my phone and it's been more than 1 months. Still they are only fixing. Everytime I call them, they tell us come back next week. By doing so, one week has been done.

Listing cons here, because there is no pro.1. Hearing issue.2. Worst camera quality, both front and back.3. Charging take stime if the screen is on, but the phone dischargea very quickly.4. For a 32k phone, this looks less classy.5. Should have gone for some less excessive but better quality phone, which some other established manufacturers are providing.Highly recommend staying away from getting into this trap and buying this phone.Also, read the fine prints. Amazon won't accept any returns, support or replacement. You need to go to service center for that. Forget about returns at all!My sim slot wasn't working at al. It has not been damaged because it was stuck and won't come out to out a sim card, thanks to the Mi service center support who somehow managed to open it (though it's damaged now). I don't even want to get started with the rude, menacing and aggressive delivery agent.My two cents - Don't buy this.

A Powerhouse of a Phone - Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus Review
","
I've been using the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus for a week now, and I must say, it's exceeded my expectations in almost every department! The phone's performance is lightning-fast, thanks to the powerful processor and ample RAM. The display is stunning, with vibrant colors and crisp visuals. Battery life is impressive, easily lasting a day with heavy usage. Cameras are top-notch, capturing detailed photos and videos. The design is sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. Call quality is top notch, even in low network areas.Cons: software and security update as given are for 03 years and 04 years respectively, they could have offered for more like for 05 years, though the phone came with Hyper OS and Android 14 out of th the box, comparing to the initial phone which came with MIUI 14 and Android 13. It will be a long wait to see how many updates i will be getting.Other only minor gripe is the lack of wireless charging, but that's a small trade-off for the incredible value this phone offers. Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying my Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus experience and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a high-performance device without breaking the bank. My review - A premium package on a mid range budget.

First of all let's go with the prosDisplay: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from  about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well‚Ä¢ some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins‚Ä¢ I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good‚Ä¢ And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperosAnd the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found‚Ä¢ and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smoothCons:I think this stuff is a bit overpricedThe camera is not up to the mark in these price rangeBut still it can be fixed with a software updateAnd the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 minsAnd the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank youüòä

Noteworthy!
","
I've been using the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ for a while now, and I have to say, it's an amazing phone, especially for the price. Here‚Äôs why I love it:Design and Feel:First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.Display:The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.Performance:Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I‚Äôve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.Camera:The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It‚Äôs perfect for snapping great photos on the go.Battery Life:Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you‚Äôre in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!Software:HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you‚Äôre coming from another brand, but it‚Äôs intuitive and has a lot of useful features.Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!

As an Xiaomi user for many years , i have purchased this phone on 31 may 2024, initially i loved the phone the looks the performance and also it's offers the ip68(IP68 is an international standard rating for the protection of electrical enclosures against dust and water. The rating is made up of two numbers, with the first number indicating protection against solids and the second number indicating protection against water. In the case of IP68, the numbers are:6Total protection against solid ingress, including small dust particles like sand and dirt8Total protection against water ingress, including complete submersion for more than 30 minutes below one meter)Water spills on my phone and gets inside the phone which effects the fingerprint sensor , cellular network not working also the charging not working and primary mic stopped working after such issues i visited near mi care to resolve the issue, firstly the decline the warrenty as the water damage is there but i asked them this phone comes with ip68 ,the said and show the inside indicator for water is red so your warrenty is voided ,and the said your phone has many damages internally so after the inspection they said you have to pay 10000rs for the replacement of parts which is 1/3cost of the smartphone.....I asked Xiaomi is this is ip68 ??I asked Xiaomi is this is your service for many year user?I have been using mi smartphone from redmi 1s till nowI asked Xiaomi this is good experience for any user as he purchased a brand new phone and this happens??

Battery backup is not upto the mark. It charges fast which is a good point but drains fast as well. Camera quality is not what you expect with 200MP camera.

Attention buyers of this phone, I have been using it for 5 days, display quality is very very good, fast charging is good, but camera quality is very very bad.  I was using xiaomi 11 lite NE 5g and its camera was 60 mp.  This 200 mp camera does not even get 25% of the quality of the photo taken by that camera.  Photos taken on xiaomi backed up to this phone lose 50% quality when opened on this phone.  Those who are interested in buying this phone after looking at the camera quality should look at other phones.

Well kudos to Amazon for delivering this fast.The phone itself is""simple""  yet has a gorgeous DCI P3 std display with wide color gamut.  Video diaply is amazing. perfect for watching movies etc.Bit heavy it does fit snugly in your hands. Out of the box synicing to the old phone and getting started to use your new phone is easy. I noticed minor lag on apps like YT however this was solved as soon as I updated the preinstalled apps. audio quality through stereo speakers is top notch.NOW the bad part of this phone is its camera department.. 200 MP is just a silly moniker.. the phone software seems to be over correcting edges around faces. portrait seem ""watery"" as from an old 90s phone  with lack of detail and texture.. on the plus side the macro camera is ok. Same story with the portrait mode.The AI in the camera doesn't show the scene detected eg food,  flowers, etc which is sad .. as you don't know what algorithm is been applied,Skin textures often seem to be blown out or phone seems to apply over smoothing in some places.  HDR mode blows out photos in bright highlights. Honestly not a  delight to use camera.The phone itself is blazing fast. and not much bloatware . Excellent for using office apps . I miss the quickball to take screenshots. and camera portions are prone to smudges or finger prints. Wish they had a more textured matte blacScreen k version.Advice... avoid if you want a good camera .. buy if you want second space feature and multi app support with powerful processing for office related apps amd occasional gamingI

Always better than glass body- hotspot, BluetoothCons - worst camera quality- 200 MP camera feels like 20 mp camera, also photo quality of 7-8 k mobile is better than this- never recommended for camera, photos, video lovers- curved edge display is for only good looking but no ise in usage rather it feels difficulties while accessing curved display area.- icon, theams and other featured are same like 9k mobile- no audio jack 3.5- No addition or impressive features for such 30k mobile.Real valuation for this mobile is 15-17k only

After a lot of search, I ended up deciding to buy this phone. After using it for about 2 weeks, I'm loving it. When compared to other manufacturers a phone with the same specifications is costing almost double the amount or a little less. I'm completely satisfied with the phone and I thought this could be of help to someone looking for a phone just like I did. Battery back up as of now is about a day and half with decent usage. This limited edition looks cool.

I bought a new redmi note 13 pro plus phone. After few days, it became un-responsive. Battery issue, it was getting restarted automatically. After service center visit, they found the motherboard of this phone is faulty. They are fixing my phone and it's been more than 1 months. Still they are only fixing. Everytime I call them, they tell us come back next week. By doing so, one week has been done.

Listing cons here, because there is no pro.1. Hearing issue.2. Worst camera quality, both front and back.3. Charging take stime if the screen is on, but the phone dischargea very quickly.4. For a 32k phone, this looks less classy.5. Should have gone for some less excessive but better quality phone, which some other established manufacturers are providing.Highly recommend staying away from getting into this trap and buying this phone.Also, read the fine prints. Amazon won't accept any returns, support or replacement. You need to go to service center for that. Forget about returns at all!My sim slot wasn't working at al. It has not been damaged because it was stuck and won't come out to out a sim card, thanks to the Mi service center support who somehow managed to open it (though it's damaged now). I don't even want to get started with the rude, menacing and aggressive delivery agent.My two cents - Don't buy this.

A Powerhouse of a Phone - Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus Review
","
I've been using the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus for a week now, and I must say, it's exceeded my expectations in almost every department! The phone's performance is lightning-fast, thanks to the powerful processor and ample RAM. The display is stunning, with vibrant colors and crisp visuals. Battery life is impressive, easily lasting a day with heavy usage. Cameras are top-notch, capturing detailed photos and videos. The design is sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. Call quality is top notch, even in low network areas.Cons: software and security update as given are for 03 years and 04 years respectively, they could have offered for more like for 05 years, though the phone came with Hyper OS and Android 14 out of th the box, comparing to the initial phone which came with MIUI 14 and Android 13. It will be a long wait to see how many updates i will be getting.Other only minor gripe is the lack of wireless charging, but that's a small trade-off for the incredible value this phone offers. Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying my Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus experience and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a high-performance device without breaking the bank. My review - A premium package on a mid range budget.

First of all let's go with the prosDisplay: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from  about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well‚Ä¢ some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins‚Ä¢ I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good‚Ä¢ And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperosAnd the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found‚Ä¢ and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smoothCons:I think this stuff is a bit overpricedThe camera is not up to the mark in these price rangeBut still it can be fixed with a software updateAnd the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 minsAnd the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank youüòä

Noteworthy!
","
I've been using the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ for a while now, and I have to say, it's an amazing phone, especially for the price. Here‚Äôs why I love it:Design and Feel:First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.Display:The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.Performance:Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I‚Äôve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.Camera:The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It‚Äôs perfect for snapping great photos on the go.Battery Life:Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you‚Äôre in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!Software:HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you‚Äôre coming from another brand, but it‚Äôs intuitive and has a lot of useful features.Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!

As an Xiaomi user for many years , i have purchased this phone on 31 may 2024, initially i loved the phone the looks the performance and also it's offers the ip68(IP68 is an international standard rating for the protection of electrical enclosures against dust and water. The rating is made up of two numbers, with the first number indicating protection against solids and the second number indicating protection against water. In the case of IP68, the numbers are:6Total protection against solid ingress, including small dust particles like sand and dirt8Total protection against water ingress, including complete submersion for more than 30 minutes below one meter)Water spills on my phone and gets inside the phone which effects the fingerprint sensor , cellular network not working also the charging not working and primary mic stopped working after such issues i visited near mi care to resolve the issue, firstly the decline the warrenty as the water damage is there but i asked them this phone comes with ip68 ,the said and show the inside indicator for water is red so your warrenty is voided ,and the said your phone has many damages internally so after the inspection they said you have to pay 10000rs for the replacement of parts which is 1/3cost of the smartphone.....I asked Xiaomi is this is ip68 ??I asked Xiaomi is this is your service for many year user?I have been using mi smartphone from redmi 1s till nowI asked Xiaomi this is good experience for any user as he purchased a brand new phone and this happens??

Battery backup is not upto the mark. It charges fast which is a good point but drains fast as well. Camera quality is not what you expect with 200MP camera. Sound is good with high volume only. on lower volume you can't hear much. screen is bright enough that you can use it in any light condition.Major issue I am facing is when i am connected to bluetooth earphone while riding bike. the person on other end keeps complaining that my voice is cracking where as i can hear the person properly. initially i thought that it might be earphone issue but i have changes earphone as well. while talking on phone without bluetooth connection it is perfect.

Attention buyers of this phone, I have been using it for 5 days, display quality is very very good, fast charging is good, but camera quality is very very bad.  I was using xiaomi 11 lite NE 5g and its camera was 60 mp.  This 200 mp camera does not even get 25% of the quality of the photo taken by that camera.  Photos taken on xiaomi backed up to this phone lose 50% quality when opened on this phone.  Those who are interested in buying this phone after looking at the camera quality should look at other phones.

An Average Performerwith Good Display
","
Well kudos to Amazon for delivering this fast.The phone itself is""simple""  yet has a gorgeous DCI P3 std display with wide color gamut.  Video diaply is amazing. perfect for watching movies etc.Bit heavy it does fit snugly in your hands. Out of the box synicing to the old phone and getting started to use your new phone is easy. I noticed minor lag on apps like YT however this was solved as soon as I updated the preinstalled apps. audio quality through stereo speakers is top notch.NOW the bad part of this phone is its camera department.. 200 MP is just a silly moniker.. the phone software seems to be over correcting edges around faces. portrait seem ""watery"" as from an old 90s phone  with lack of detail and texture.. on the plus side the macro camera is ok. Same story with the portrait mode.The AI in the camera doesn't show the scene detected eg food,  flowers, etc which is sad .. as you don't know what algorithm is been applied,Skin textures often seem to be blown out or phone seems to apply over smoothing in some places.  HDR mode blows out photos in bright highlights. Honestly not a  delight to use camera.The phone itself is blazing fast. and not much bloatware . Excellent for using office apps . I miss the quickball to take screenshots. and camera portions are prone to smudges or finger prints. Wish they had a more textured matte blacScreen k version.Advice... avoid if you want a good camera .. buy if you want second space feature and multi app support with powerful processing for office related apps amd occasional gamingI

Review after 2 month usagePros - best battery life which lasts for 2 days with average regular usage, calls, video, hotspot, etc.- 120 mw charger is really works great and full charge in 20 -22 min- Never heatup amazing coolig feature- Operating system is superfast processing- Looks great- mobile body is good, it will not allow to fall down, not a slippery. Always better than glass body- hotspot, BluetoothCons - worst camera quality- 200 MP camera feels like 20 mp camera, also photo quality of 7-8 k mobile is better than this- never recommended for camera, photos, video lovers- curved edge display is for only good looking but no ise in usage rather it feels difficulties while accessing curved display area.- icon, theams and other featured are same like 9k mobile- no audio jack 3.5- No addition or impressive features for such 30k mobile.Real valuation for this mobile is 15-17k only

After a lot of search, I ended up deciding to buy this phone. After using it for about 2 weeks, I'm loving it. When compared to other manufacturers a phone with the same specifications is costing almost double the amount or a little less. I'm completely satisfied with the phone and I thought this could be of help to someone looking for a phone just like I did. Battery back up as of now is about a day and half with decent usage.

Should have gone for some less excessive but better quality phone, which some other established manufacturers are providing.Highly recommend staying away from getting into this trap and buying this phone.Also, read the fine prints. Amazon won't accept any returns, support or replacement. You need to go to service center for that. Forget about returns at all!My sim slot wasn't working at al. It has not been damaged because it was stuck and won't come out to out a sim card, thanks to the Mi service center support who somehow managed to open it (though it's damaged now). I don't even want to get started with the rude, menacing and aggressive delivery agent.My two cents - Don't buy this.

Camera Beast
","
The Samsung Galaxy A14 5G is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers a decent mix of features and performance. It has a 6.6-inch 1080p LCD display with a 90Hz refresh rate, a MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a 50MP rear camera, a 13MP front camera, and a 5,000mAh battery.The Galaxy A14 5G is a good choice for people who are looking for a basic smartphone with 5G connectivity. It's not the fastest phone on the market, but it's fast enough for most tasks. The display is sharp and vibrant, and the 90Hz refresh rate makes scrolling and animations feel smooth. The battery life is also excellent, and the phone can easily last a full day on a single charge.The camera is one of the weaker points of the Galaxy A14 5G. The main camera takes decent photos in good lighting, but the quality drops off significantly in low light. The front camera is also a bit underwhelming.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G is a good budget-friendly smartphone with 5G connectivity. It's not the best phone on the market, but it offers a good value for the price.Here are some of the pros and cons of the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G:Pros:5G connectivitySharp and vibrant display90Hz refresh rateLong battery lifeAffordable priceCons:Camera is not great in low lightFront camera is a bit underwhelmingPerformance can be a bit slow at timesIf you're looking for a basic smartphone with 5G connectivity, the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G is a good option.

Urgent: A14 5G Display Quality Concerns Compared to Competitor's DeviceDear Samsung Customer Support,I hope this message reaches you promptly. I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the display quality of my recently purchased Samsung A14 5G smartphone. As a dedicated Samsung user, it pains me to report that the display on my A14 5G does not meet the expected standards, especially when compared to a competitor's device, the Redmi 12C.Upon extensive testing, I have observed that the A14 5G's display fails to produce sharp images, notably when streaming YouTube videos. Surprisingly, the Redmi 12C, a device from a different brand, consistently delivers a crisper and more vibrant visual experience.I have ensured that all software and applications are up to date on my Samsung device, and I've taken various measures to optimize the display settings. However, the disparity in image sharpness remains pronounced, and this is a cause for concern.As a loyal Samsung cus

1month review - Phone is light weight.  I bought light green color. It's look beautiful.  Everyone  like this. Usage of the device is good.Sound and camera clarity is not satisfied. If sound and camera is good its fully worth for the amount 21,000. Sound is not that much high  but getting soft and clear sound.If internet usage is low battery capacity is upto 2 days.

","
Bought Samsung A14 phone, within six months, suddenly one fine day it has stopped working. Visited samsung service centre and requested them to deliver the phone post correction of the problem as my phone was still under warranty, got a call from them that your phone has liquid problem,that means water has gone inside for the correction, mother board to be changed which is 70 % of the total cost of the phone. I kept telling them nothing is done of that sort from our side but they are bi ear for the same. Pathetic! Nevery every buy Samsung products

Never had this disgusting experience with Amazon before. Got a sealed open box of the phone, when lodged complaint they asked me to use the phone, if get any issue then will be resolved. I insisted to get it replaced as timwhy will I use a phone the box of which was tempered. They said we lodged a complaint, and will look into the matter for which I will have to wait for 5days, I waited and on the the 6th day tried to contact the customer service but my phone was never answered in the meanwhile the return and replacement window got closed. What a strategy they played and made fool of me. I will insist never to buy electronic items through Amazon. It sucks as I am stuck now, with no way to.contact them.

I am very much disappointed with this samsung a14 handset.  In the first use it self i felt some problem in touch. Some time the touch is normal but some time i need to touch two three times with more pressure.  As i started using the phone i didnt want to return so i took it as minor issue. I have already spend money for the cover, screen guard charge etc.  But  Yesterday evening (5th March 2024) exactly one month after the purchase of this phone it got struck and touch is not at all working. I couldn't even switch it off. When i long press on right button the screen will show switch off, restart options but as touch is not working can't select the option. The shorts which was playing, it was continuously playing. Message alert was also shows. What will i do?. Please replace with a new working handset.

Mobile got heat when you connect it for charging and when you do some multiple work at same time and battery backup is not much good. Charging speed is good. Touch sensitivity, camera quality and functionality is at the top. It has a sleek and modern design which I like the most. It is a good phone for moderate user and definitely not for gamers.

Well after a lit of deliberation finally settled for Samsung A35. Have been using samsung A22 for quite sometime now and wanted to switch over to moto or one plus but after a lot of review I brought this phone. For an average user this phone is worth it. The display is amazing, the camera is really good and the phone works pretty smoothly. No complaints at all. I did not find any heating issue. The phone goes on for about a day with normal usage. I have been using usual media app like YouTube insta etc and the pictures and sound quality is very good. The are some AI features added which come very handy using your cam. Best part is 4 yrs of software updates which Samsung is guaranteed to deliver ND the phone is safe. I dropped the phone a few times but the screen is good.The only draw back is they do not provide charger or other accessories in the box. Also the charing is pretty slow takes more than an hr to charge up.Else Samsung phones are very reliable. Happy with the product.

","
Undoubtedly the Phone is excellent in terms of look, display and the advance features it has to offer, but you will have to compromise on the battery backup and charging side.  It takes around two hours to charge completely with a 25 W original Samsung adapter and the joke is that it displays a message as 'Super fast charging'.  Also the battery comes down fast even with normal use and you will feel frustrated when you will have to leave the phone on charging again.  Samsung just wants its Customers to go for flagship higher end phones or else pay the price for buying this mid range good looking phone on lower price.

The design looks great and the feel of the phone is somewhat close to iPhone. I have been using the phone for a week now and it is performing well.At this moment, the only flaw I see is the battery charging.Samsung says that it supports fast charging, but what is fast charging 0-100 in more than 3 hours? Then the question is what is slow charging as per Samsung?If you are in a rush, you cannot get it charged quickly and I am not sure why Samsung cannot provide fast charging in real.I like Samsung phones for their sturdiness and I can rely on them that they will never break down, but charging keeps me away from their high-end phones.

I have purchased the Samsung A35. Product is in good condition, and Samsung A35 is excellent.However I have an issue with Amazon's price listing:Two different Prices Listed on Amazon:1. With exchange bonous offer Price is Rs.30,999 and2. Other offer it is Rs.22,800With offer price is almost Rs. 8,199 more compared to other price.Amazon enhanced price and and giving offer on enhanced price (cheap trick).I have opted for with offer and exchange of my old Mi A3 as I thought I will get better price.Details:Price with Offer  :  Rs. 30,999 (price listed on Amazon)Bonous Discount  :  - Rs.  3,500Exchange on Phone:  - Rs.  2,610Bank Offer  :  - Rs.  5,000Exchange Price : Rs. 149----------------------------------------Effective Price  :  Rs. 20,038-----------------------------------------However, Amazon made me to pay Rs. 2610 for old phone saying due to damage.Means I got no exchange for my old phone.Now the effective price I paid is  Rs. 22,648Lets talk about without offer:Price Listed on Amazon is Rs. 22,800Therefore my old phone exchange value is just (Rs.22,800- Rs.22,648) = Rs.152 only.What a nonsence Amazon?Without exhange I would have got atleast Rs. 1,500 offer on credit card, which would have resulted in lesser price offered by Amazon.

Excellent budget phone especially for senior citizens
","
It's SAMSUNG. So with the brand name comes phone durability and good battery life.This phone is excellent choice for senior citizens who want to use it for WhatsApp, calling and photos. Photo quality is good, more than the value for money. Big screen and good resolution. It's not a gaming phone. Go for another phone if you want lag free experienceOverall, it's more than the value for money.

Bought it for 6.5k. Does its job nicely. Good quality phone. Battery back up might be an issue in the future.Camera is good for this price.Good for people who do not play a lot of games on the phone.Data processing is pretty fast.Lesser screen pixels do not matter. You wont find any difference between this screen and phones with higher screen pixel.Value for money. Highly recommended.

A Solid Choice for Everyday Use
","
I've been using this Samsung phone for a bit, and here's the lowdown. Considering it costs around ‚Çπ6,500-‚Çπ7,000, I think it's a pretty great deal.Sure, there are some compromises. No fingerprint sensor (the face unlock compensates some what for that), and yeah, not having a charger in the box is a bit of a hassle if you don't already have one. The speakers could be better, and a Full HD display would've been nice.But let's be real, at this price point, you can't expect perfection. If you're like me and just need a reliable phone for everyday stuff ‚Äì calls, texts, social media, and some streaming ‚Äì this phone gets the job done.Gaming enthusiasts might want to look elsewhere, but for casual users, I think this Samsung device is a solid choice.Would I recommend? Absolutely, for basic usage.

You can use bubblepnp for screen casting . 99rs for the paid app to get DLNA licence. It's great.

Perfect Productivity Phone
","
I bought this phone for the office/work related things. When I started using this I never expected it to so big and so smooth for it's price. Even better the software experience is is top notch, One UI 6.1 never disappoints. I never tried gaming as it is a work phone and I don't think it will hold graphic intensive games and 4 GB ram means the apps will always reload when you switch tabs for some time (not an issue for me). Other than that this phone is got the best value for money.

","
The Samsung M05 offers a big display and is priced around 6500 rupees, making it a solid choice for budget-conscious buyers. However, I was disappointed with the exchange process; the person collecting the phone took my charger and cable as well, which felt unfair. Overall, it's a decent phone but be cautious during exchanges.

A Solid Choice for Everyday Use
","
I've been using this Samsung phone for a bit, and here's the lowdown. Considering it costs around ‚Çπ6,500-‚Çπ7,000, I think it's a pretty great deal.Sure, there are some compromises. No fingerprint sensor (the face unlock compensates some what for that), and yeah, not having a charger in the box is a bit of a hassle if you don't already have one. The speakers could be better, and a Full HD display would've been nice.But let's be real, at this price point, you can't expect perfection. If you're like me and just need a reliable phone for everyday stuff ‚Äì calls, texts, social media, and some streaming ‚Äì this phone gets the job done.Gaming enthusiasts might want to look elsewhere, but for casual users, I think this Samsung device is a solid choice.Would I recommend? Absolutely, for basic usage.

It's SAMSUNG. So with the brand name comes phone durability and good battery life.This phone is excellent choice for senior citizens who want to use it for WhatsApp, calling and photos. Photo quality is good, more than the value for money. Big screen and good resolution. It's not a gaming phone. Go for another phone if you want lag free experienceOverall, it's more than the value for money.

Recommended for those who need a best quality budget smatphone.  This has all important features of a midrange samsung phone except smartview and screen recording.  Those two features are very important bur due to budget catagoury samsung has not installed  their native app of  screen mirrioring and screen casting and screen recorder.  You can use bubblepnp for screen casting . 99rs for the paid app to get DLNA licence. It's great.  Screen recorder A-Z recorder is available but don't expect like samsungg native screen recording app quality.

I bought this phone for the office/work related things. When I started using this I never expected it to so big and so smooth for it's price. Even better the software experience is is top notch, One UI 6.1 never disappoints. I never tried gaming as it is a work phone and I don't think it will hold graphic intensive games and 4 GB ram means the apps will always reload when you switch tabs for some time (not an issue for me). Other than that this phone is got the best value for money.

Many people get confuse between Samsung M14  & M14 4g. Difference is that later gets snapdragon and former gets Exynos processor both work good.Pros-Snapdragon processor 665.Screen gets 393 PPI resolution,6.7"" display, 90hertz refresh rate.Ram /Rom 4/64gb.2 sim and dedicated memory card slot.C Type charging slot.C to C charging cable is provided with 25 watt fast charging capacity.Triple camera 50mp+ 2mp+2mp at back and 13mp camera for selfie , quality is good.Finger print sensor is given side mounted.Battyback is good provides 2 days backup. I don't play games.2 gen of OS updates(when u start first updates takes place) and 4 years of security updates.Works smooth no lagCons-Not for heavy gamers. Lite games onlyAdaptor is not given ,I suggest buy only Samsung adaptor 25Watt while purchasing mobile.Samsung please provide adaptor with mobile handset

Honest Review - 5 Days of Usage
","
This is my first Samsung phone (coming from a Poco F1). Here is my genuine experience.PROS -1. It has a beautiful display, with very good resolution and brightness even in sunny daylight. I'm running the phone on 90Hz refresh rate without any noticeable difference in my battery consumption.2. Battery life is excellent. I'm using a single SIM in 4G and a full charge lasted around 2 days for me. It has very good standby time. I received a USB Type-C cable with the phone but had to buy the 25w adapter separately. The charging speed is good and the phone has fast charging.3. Camera is decent. Photos seem well lit but lack a bit of detail. That is expected in this price range. Maybe GCam would yield better photos. I have yet to try.4. It comes with OneUI 6.1 running on Android 14 out of the box and the software experience seems to be solid. I haven't encountered any crashes as of now. All the apps seems to be well optimised.5. I haven't encountered any major heating issues until now, maybe because I don't use my phone as a workhorse.Can't say anything about gaming since I'm not into it.CONS -1. The absolute biggest con that I noticed is that this phone has NO ALWAYS ON DISPLAY. Samsung users will know that AOD is something Samsung phones are known for. Although this phone is fully capable of it, the feature itself has been disabled by Samsung in the core software.2. I'm not sure if this is a con, but still worth mentioning. The Samsung M15 5G and the M15 5G Prime are NOT different phones. This one just has a ""Prime"" sticker pasted on the box. Even the software identifies the phone as an M15.3. Although there are no major lags, but if you are coming from a phone with better specs you will notice a lack of smoothness common in most budget phones.4. No form of toughened glass for the display like Gorilla, etc.Overall I feel this is an excellent phone for the price and in this range it is probably the best.Hope the above information helps.

I have encountered the following problems with Samsung Galaxy M15 5G model phone:1- The bottom space, up to one centimetre on the screen, is unresponsive to the touch.2- Phone is getting heated during charging.3- Getting ear pain while talking over this phone.I have complained to Amazon. They said a technician will visit my home and gave me a schedule time. But nobody turned up. That technician called me over phone and took some details. Finally, Amazon gave me the weblink of Samsung service providers list.They are not offering either replacement or refund or collection of item from our door for repair service.Better keep away from this model.

Honest Review - 5 Days of Usage
","
This is my first Samsung phone (coming from a Poco F1). Here is my genuine experience.PROS -1. It has a beautiful display, with very good resolution and brightness even in sunny daylight. I'm running the phone on 90Hz refresh rate without any noticeable difference in my battery consumption.2. Battery life is excellent. I'm using a single SIM in 4G and a full charge lasted around 2 days for me. It has very good standby time. I received a USB Type-C cable with the phone but had to buy the 25w adapter separately. The charging speed is good and the phone has fast charging.3. Camera is decent. Photos seem well lit but lack a bit of detail. That is expected in this price range. Maybe GCam would yield better photos. I have yet to try.4. It comes with OneUI 6.1 running on Android 14 out of the box and the software experience seems to be solid. I haven't encountered any crashes as of now. All the apps seems to be well optimised.5. I haven't encountered any major heating issues until now, maybe because I don't use my phone as a workhorse.Can't say anything about gaming since I'm not into it.CONS -1. The absolute biggest con that I noticed is that this phone has NO ALWAYS ON DISPLAY. Samsung users will know that AOD is something Samsung phones are known for. Although this phone is fully capable of it, the feature itself has been disabled by Samsung in the core software.2. I'm not sure if this is a con, but still worth mentioning. The Samsung M15 5G and the M15 5G Prime are NOT different phones. This one just has a ""Prime"" sticker pasted on the box. Even the software identifies the phone as an M15.3. Although there are no major lags, but if you are coming from a phone with better specs you will notice a lack of smoothness common in most budget phones.4. No form of toughened glass for the display like Gorilla, etc.Overall I feel this is an excellent phone for the price and in this range it is probably the best.Hope the above information helps.

Fault with the model itself.
","
I have encountered the following problems with Samsung Galaxy M15 5G model phone:1- The bottom space, up to one centimetre on the screen, is unresponsive to the touch.2- Phone is getting heated during charging.3- Getting ear pain while talking over this phone.I have complained to Amazon. They said a technician will visit my home and gave me a schedule time. But nobody turned up. That technician called me over phone and took some details. Finally, Amazon gave me the weblink of Samsung service providers list.They are not offering either replacement or refund or collection of item from our door for repair service.Better keep away from this model.

Heating issue

If you play a full movie or wach a game it will become hot.Battery goes for long.Charging also takes long time.More to say that they are not giving any charger along with the phone, only a c-type cable will be provide by them.Screen is good to watch for eyes.I have not use the camera too much in the short time, just take one or two selfies, these are not bad.

Poor Quality phone from samsung
","
Its a phone of poor quality from Samsung in my family many samsung phones are there but this one is a poorest quality . Often on the incoming calls unable to listen at our end or at callers end. Often network quality is poor though good network in the other phones of same service provider we see. Definitely receiving antenna /device is not upto the mark. Ultimately zero marks for this unit

Honest Review - 5 Days of Usage
","
This is my first Samsung phone (coming from a Poco F1). Here is my genuine experience.PROS -1. It has a beautiful display, with very good resolution and brightness even in sunny daylight. I'm running the phone on 90Hz refresh rate without any noticeable difference in my battery consumption.2. Battery life is excellent. I'm using a single SIM in 4G and a full charge lasted around 2 days for me. It has very good standby time. I received a USB Type-C cable with the phone but had to buy the 25w adapter separately. The charging speed is good and the phone has fast charging.3. Camera is decent. Photos seem well lit but lack a bit of detail. That is expected in this price range. Maybe GCam would yield better photos. I have yet to try.4. It comes with OneUI 6.1 running on Android 14 out of the box and the software experience seems to be solid. I haven't encountered any crashes as of now. All the apps seems to be well optimised.5. I haven't encountered any major heating issues until now, maybe because I don't use my phone as a workhorse.Can't say anything about gaming since I'm not into it.CONS -1. The absolute biggest con that I noticed is that this phone has NO ALWAYS ON DISPLAY. Samsung users will know that AOD is something Samsung phones are known for. Although this phone is fully capable of it, the feature itself has been disabled by Samsung in the core software.2. I'm not sure if this is a con, but still worth mentioning. The Samsung M15 5G and the M15 5G Prime are NOT different phones. This one just has a ""Prime"" sticker pasted on the box. Even the software identifies the phone as an M15.3. Although there are no major lags, but if you are coming from a phone with better specs you will notice a lack of smoothness common in most budget phones.4. No form of toughened glass for the display like Gorilla, etc.Overall I feel this is an excellent phone for the price and in this range it is probably the best.Hope the above information helps.

Fault with the model itself.
","
I have encountered the following problems with Samsung Galaxy M15 5G model phone:1- The bottom space, up to one centimetre on the screen, is unresponsive to the touch.2- Phone is getting heated during charging.3- Getting ear pain while talking over this phone.I have complained to Amazon. They said a technician will visit my home and gave me a schedule time. But nobody turned up. That technician called me over phone and took some details. Finally, Amazon gave me the weblink of Samsung service providers list.They are not offering either replacement or refund or collection of item from our door for repair service.Better keep away from this model.

Its a phone of poor quality from Samsung in my family many samsung phones are there but this one is a poorest quality . Often on the incoming calls unable to listen at our end or at callers end. Often network quality is poor though good network in the other phones of same service provider we see. Definitely receiving antenna /device is not upto the mark. Ultimately zero marks for this unit

Honest Review - 5 Days of Usage
","
This is my first Samsung phone (coming from a Poco F1). Here is my genuine experience.PROS -1. It has a beautiful display, with very good resolution and brightness even in sunny daylight. I'm running the phone on 90Hz refresh rate without any noticeable difference in my battery consumption.2. Battery life is excellent. I'm using a single SIM in 4G and a full charge lasted around 2 days for me. It has very good standby time. I received a USB Type-C cable with the phone but had to buy the 25w adapter separately. The charging speed is good and the phone has fast charging.3. Camera is decent. Photos seem well lit but lack a bit of detail. That is expected in this price range. Maybe GCam would yield better photos. I have yet to try.4. It comes with OneUI 6.1 running on Android 14 out of the box and the software experience seems to be solid. I haven't encountered any crashes as of now. All the apps seems to be well optimised.5. I haven't encountered any major heating issues until now, maybe because I don't use my phone as a workhorse.Can't say anything about gaming since I'm not into it.CONS -1. The absolute biggest con that I noticed is that this phone has NO ALWAYS ON DISPLAY. Samsung users will know that AOD is something Samsung phones are known for. Although this phone is fully capable of it, the feature itself has been disabled by Samsung in the core software.2. I'm not sure if this is a con, but still worth mentioning. The Samsung M15 5G and the M15 5G Prime are NOT different phones. This one just has a ""Prime"" sticker pasted on the box. Even the software identifies the phone as an M15.3. Although there are no major lags, but if you are coming from a phone with better specs you will notice a lack of smoothness common in most budget phones.4. No form of toughened glass for the display like Gorilla, etc.Overall I feel this is an excellent phone for the price and in this range it is probably the best.Hope the above information helps.

Fault with the model itself.
","
I have encountered the following problems with Samsung Galaxy M15 5G model phone:1- The bottom space, up to one centimetre on the screen, is unresponsive to the touch.2- Phone is getting heated during charging.3- Getting ear pain while talking over this phone.I have complained to Amazon. They said a technician will visit my home and gave me a schedule time. But nobody turned up. That technician called me over phone and took some details. Finally, Amazon gave me the weblink of Samsung service providers list.They are not offering either replacement or refund or collection of item from our door for repair service.Better keep away from this model.

Honest Review - 5 Days of Usage
","
This is my first Samsung phone (coming from a Poco F1). Here is my genuine experience.PROS -1. It has a beautiful display, with very good resolution and brightness even in sunny daylight. I'm running the phone on 90Hz refresh rate without any noticeable difference in my battery consumption.2. Battery life is excellent. I'm using a single SIM in 4G and a full charge lasted around 2 days for me. It has very good standby time. I received a USB Type-C cable with the phone but had to buy the 25w adapter separately. The charging speed is good and the phone has fast charging.3. Camera is decent. Photos seem well lit but lack a bit of detail. That is expected in this price range. Maybe GCam would yield better photos. I have yet to try.4. It comes with OneUI 6.1 running on Android 14 out of the box and the software experience seems to be solid. I haven't encountered any crashes as of now. All the apps seems to be well optimised.5. I haven't encountered any major heating issues until now, maybe because I don't use my phone as a workhorse.Can't say anything about gaming since I'm not into it.CONS -1. The absolute biggest con that I noticed is that this phone has NO ALWAYS ON DISPLAY. Samsung users will know that AOD is something Samsung phones are known for. Although this phone is fully capable of it, the feature itself has been disabled by Samsung in the core software.2. I'm not sure if this is a con, but still worth mentioning. The Samsung M15 5G and the M15 5G Prime are NOT different phones. This one just has a ""Prime"" sticker pasted on the box. Even the software identifies the phone as an M15.3. Although there are no major lags, but if you are coming from a phone with better specs you will notice a lack of smoothness common in most budget phones.4. No form of toughened glass for the display like Gorilla, etc.Overall I feel this is an excellent phone for the price and in this range it is probably the best.Hope the above information helps.

Fault with the model itself.
","
I have encountered the following problems with Samsung Galaxy M15 5G model phone:1- The bottom space, up to one centimetre on the screen, is unresponsive to the touch.2- Phone is getting heated during charging.3- Getting ear pain while talking over this phone.I have complained to Amazon. They said a technician will visit my home and gave me a schedule time. But nobody turned up. That technician called me over phone and took some details. Finally, Amazon gave me the weblink of Samsung service providers list.They are not offering either replacement or refund or collection of item from our door for repair service.Better keep away from this model.

The display is the best in the given cost frame  buy atleast a 6gb variant lower to  that will have lagging issues. The weight management  of the phone is good .  The back plastic is of cheap quality and there is no charger but that 4+5 compensates for that .

If you play a full movie or wach a game it will become hot.Battery goes for long.Charging also takes long time.More to say that they are not giving any charger along with the phone, only a c-type cable will be provide by them.Screen is good to watch for eyes.I have not use the camera too much in the short time, just take one or two selfies, these are not bad.

Its a phone of poor quality from Samsung in my family many samsung phones are there but this one is a poorest quality . Often on the incoming calls unable to listen at our end or at callers end. Often network quality is poor though good network in the other phones of same service provider we see. Definitely receiving antenna /device is not upto the mark. Ultimately zero marks for this unit

Honest Review - 5 Days of Usage
","
This is my first Samsung phone (coming from a Poco F1). Here is my genuine experience.PROS -1. It has a beautiful display, with very good resolution and brightness even in sunny daylight. I'm running the phone on 90Hz refresh rate without any noticeable difference in my battery consumption.2. Battery life is excellent. I'm using a single SIM in 4G and a full charge lasted around 2 days for me. It has very good standby time. I received a USB Type-C cable with the phone but had to buy the 25w adapter separately. The charging speed is good and the phone has fast charging.3. Camera is decent. Photos seem well lit but lack a bit of detail. That is expected in this price range. Maybe GCam would yield better photos. I have yet to try.4. It comes with OneUI 6.1 running on Android 14 out of the box and the software experience seems to be solid. I haven't encountered any crashes as of now. All the apps seems to be well optimised.5. I haven't encountered any major heating issues until now, maybe because I don't use my phone as a workhorse.Can't say anything about gaming since I'm not into it.CONS -1. The absolute biggest con that I noticed is that this phone has NO ALWAYS ON DISPLAY. Samsung users will know that AOD is something Samsung phones are known for. Although this phone is fully capable of it, the feature itself has been disabled by Samsung in the core software.2. I'm not sure if this is a con, but still worth mentioning. The Samsung M15 5G and the M15 5G Prime are NOT different phones. This one just has a ""Prime"" sticker pasted on the box. Even the software identifies the phone as an M15.3. Although there are no major lags, but if you are coming from a phone with better specs you will notice a lack of smoothness common in most budget phones.4. No form of toughened glass for the display like Gorilla, etc.Overall I feel this is an excellent phone for the price and in this range it is probably the best.Hope the above information helps.

Fault with the model itself.
","
I have encountered the following problems with Samsung Galaxy M15 5G model phone:1- The bottom space, up to one centimetre on the screen, is unresponsive to the touch.2- Phone is getting heated during charging.3- Getting ear pain while talking over this phone.I have complained to Amazon. They said a technician will visit my home and gave me a schedule time. But nobody turned up. That technician called me over phone and took some details. Finally, Amazon gave me the weblink of Samsung service providers list.They are not offering either replacement or refund or collection of item from our door for repair service.Better keep away from this model.

Honest Review - 5 Days of Usage
","
This is my first Samsung phone (coming from a Poco F1). Here is my genuine experience.PROS -1. It has a beautiful display, with very good resolution and brightness even in sunny daylight. I'm running the phone on 90Hz refresh rate without any noticeable difference in my battery consumption.2. Battery life is excellent. I'm using a single SIM in 4G and a full charge lasted around 2 days for me. It has very good standby time. I received a USB Type-C cable with the phone but had to buy the 25w adapter separately. The charging speed is good and the phone has fast charging.3. Camera is decent. Photos seem well lit but lack a bit of detail. That is expected in this price range. Maybe GCam would yield better photos. I have yet to try.4. It comes with OneUI 6.1 running on Android 14 out of the box and the software experience seems to be solid. I haven't encountered any crashes as of now. All the apps seems to be well optimised.5. I haven't encountered any major heating issues until now, maybe because I don't use my phone as a workhorse.Can't say anything about gaming since I'm not into it.CONS -1. The absolute biggest con that I noticed is that this phone has NO ALWAYS ON DISPLAY. Samsung users will know that AOD is something Samsung phones are known for. Although this phone is fully capable of it, the feature itself has been disabled by Samsung in the core software.2. I'm not sure if this is a con, but still worth mentioning. The Samsung M15 5G and the M15 5G Prime are NOT different phones. This one just has a ""Prime"" sticker pasted on the box. Even the software identifies the phone as an M15.3. Although there are no major lags, but if you are coming from a phone with better specs you will notice a lack of smoothness common in most budget phones.4. No form of toughened glass for the display like Gorilla, etc.Overall I feel this is an excellent phone for the price and in this range it is probably the best.Hope the above information helps.

Fault with the model itself.
","
I have encountered the following problems with Samsung Galaxy M15 5G model phone:1- The bottom space, up to one centimetre on the screen, is unresponsive to the touch.2- Phone is getting heated during charging.3- Getting ear pain while talking over this phone.I have complained to Amazon. They said a technician will visit my home and gave me a schedule time. But nobody turned up. That technician called me over phone and took some details. Finally, Amazon gave me the weblink of Samsung service providers list.They are not offering either replacement or refund or collection of item from our door for repair service.Better keep away from this model.

If you play a full movie or wach a game it will become hot.Battery goes for long.Charging also takes long time.More to say that they are not giving any charger along with the phone, only a c-type cable will be provide by them.Screen is good to watch for eyes.I have not use the camera too much in the short time, just take one or two selfies, these are not bad.

Pros:- Great battery backup. With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector. So, need to shell out extra money for these.

Heavy and bulky (222 grams and 9 mm thick without case), but it is due to 6000 mAH battery and vapour cooling chamber2. Thick bezels (but uniform)3. No IPXX rating (it is expected in INR 20k priced phone)4. No charger in box and charging takes 1 hour 40 minutes from zero to 100% with 25 watt charger, type-C cable in box but length is short5. Not for heavy gamersThis review is after 25 days of use, I bought 8 GB, 256 GB for INR 22.5k including 2k bank discount..I suggest buyers to install tempered glass and case immediately after receiving the unit..

Amazing
","
It's works just as they advertised it .THE DISPLAY is really good , after all it's a SAMSUNG OLED panel , the colour and viewing angles are astonishing .THE SOUND is crisp it's not too loud , it's on the comforting side but it is very crisp and it has DOLBY ATMOS support for compatible songs and videos too .THE PERFORMANCE is very good at this price point , it's not a gaming phone you have to keep that in mind it's an all-around balanced phone that checks all the boxes ... in that sense day to usage the performance is really good and heating isn't an issue the vapour chamber does work well . It keeps the phone cool , however you can absolutely do light gaming on it ... performance is very stable and it doesn't throttle at all .THE CAMERA is good it takes sharp and detailed images in good conditions and even in low lights the shots are decent ... The colour science on all the 3 cameras (excluding the macro lens) is very consistent . Shots taken are good , portrait mode has decent edge detection . Pictures are vivid and punchy coloured (as expected from SAMSUNG tuning)... Selfie are crisp too skin is almost perfect as the vivids the tones a bit .THE BATTERY is big changes grade , you can't kill the phone even if you use it all day ... even on heavy usage the phone lasted about a bit short of 1.5 days for me . The charging is capped to 25w but you have to buy the charger separately... but charging speed is fine . No complains on that .THE BUILD is really good , yes it is plastic frame with acrylic back but it's sturdy af ... front is Corning's Victus+ that's the same on from my Galaxy S22 , it has tougher Crack resistance but it can scratch , so I recommend using a protector film or glass .Overall the experience is reallllly good for the price I paid for it (‚Çπ18499 for 8 ,128GB variant) I will highly recommend this if you want an all-around balanced phone .

Display(9/10): 6.5inch may feel small but still it's good. The amoled is working perfectly giving vibrant colours(not natural). Resolution is 1080p.Build(7/10): This feels very boxy type and bulky but still acceptable. It has plastic so scratches are possible.Performance(8/10): While this phone isn't made for gaming but it deliveres good performance in casual gaming and daily use. Not recommended for hardcore gamersCamera(10/10): In this price range camera is of best quality. Photo looks more natural, the ois is working perfectly. The video quality isn't that good but acceptable.Network(10/10): It has all the 13 bands so it can use 5g at full speed. Till now no network issue is found from the phone.Disadvantages: It does not have a 3.5mm audio jack. Charger cable was only included and it supports only 25watt charging which is low and takes 1 hours 25 minutes to full charge( tested on 22.5 watt charger). Heating issue is very bad point for this phone. It doesn't have basic settings features like show connection speed,etc.

So far so good
","
Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radIOS are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.

Though heavily hyped in social media platforms, bragged much about battery, SOT, camera and bla bla, its performance is nearly average. In camera, back side photography is not up to the mark, but in this price range, videography and selfie camera are good. Battery backup is average, I am getting 7-8 hours of SOT even in average use of YouTube, browser, and social media that's it, though people hyped saying "" iski battery khatam hi nahi hoti kitna hi use kar lo"".I am partially satisfied with it. Even my last used phone F12 clicks much better photos than this. Before F12 I was using M51 which was also one of the best phones in battery backup and camera.Bezels are very big verifying that it is a cheaper phone. Phone get heats up while charging idle. Took ages to charge when One Plus and other brands giving 100W charging support. Also, charger is very expensive, unlike the phone. But we  Samsung users are like "" noon roti khaenge par phone Samsung ka hi lenge, Theek Hai""I am satisfied with the pricing, I got in 47.60% discount from MRP in great India sales after returning my old phone though its screen was shattered but accepted.What to say but I can recommend only after seeing the pricing and when u don't care much about deeper things in the phone, suitable for our ""bade bujurg"" but not for choosy and techie type people.

If you know what to expect, this is a solid device !!
","
I was using the Moto G85 but my uncle needed to change his phone and he loved that phone so I decided getting this as I was using the M34 as my secondary device for my work.Very honestly, let me come clean, this phone will make sense to you if you know what you are getting into. For starters, this is without the doubt the best camera setup under 20K. The images are mostly of natural colors and good sharpness and details. The video capabilities are great too with 4K recording on both front and rear cameras. The video stabilisation is good too. However, the selfie camera and low light selfie images could have been better. I got the 6/128 model at 14K and at that price it is the best camera rear camera setup. An image taken on this camera has been attached for reference.The battery life is awesome. Expect a solid 7 hours SOT with 30 percent juice left under moderate use like YouTube, social media, music, a bit of camera use, Whatsapp and and a few calls on WiFi as well as 5G.The OS is just brilliant and I love One UI, I guess even more than stock Android. I have used Apple devices in the past and loved the experience and I can say the same for One UI. Also, Knox security is something you will always appreciate.And now the main question everyone would ask - what about Exynos? Well, in my honest opinion, the 1380 is much more optimized than the 1280 was in the M34. This chip handles daily tasks well. There are very little micro stutters mainly in animation and app switching, but that's about it. The phone does get warm but never overheats. The vapour cooling chamber works well. The CPU doesn't throttle much too. The Geekbench scores are impressive with approximately 1000 single core and 2800 multi core scores. I don't game so I can't answer for that. But overall this is a solid chip for daily usage.Now there is one thing I have a slight confusion about. The display is great with a punch hole, though the bezels are big. That isn't a huge concern to me but what bothered me initially is that the bezels made the phone much wider and slightly uncomfortable initially. I am used to it now. The display is a solid A+ though. Samsung's inhouse 120Hz sAMOLED is awesome. Just the brightness under direct sunlight is 1000 nits which might be a bit less for outdoor usage.The fingerprint reader is accurate if not the fastest. But the lack of IP is a thing to keep in mind. Use a good case to reduce chance of water damage. It should be fine, just don't dunk it in a lake.The stereo speakers sound good if not great. I felt it could have used a little more bass. But the Dolby Atmos support helps it a lot.Overall, what I feel is if you keep your expectations in check, this is a solid phone and perhaps the best phone if you can get it at 15K-17K price range for moderate use.

So overall performance of the phone is nice-Pros-~Camera- 4.8/5 (video quality should be better)~Display- 5/5 supports 2K HDR~Battery- 5/5~Performance- 4/5  (bgmi can run on smooth extreme settings )Cons-~Ui- 3/5 simple and good but small glitches~Heating issues- 2.5/5 ( you may feel heat while data transfer,charging and long term gaming.)~Charging speed- 2/5 ( required atleast 2 hours for full charging )~No in display fingerprint~proximity sensor glitches while calling (screen closes when we put the phone near ear and doesn't open when we go far from ear )Overall it's 3.8/5 but I totally like it ‚ô•Ô∏è

After use of 1week+ my review1st of all i bought this phone for my parents which it's fiets goodCons- feels very habby, batter charge takes long long time I have 15 watt samsung charger which takes 2.20-2.30 hr time to take charge nd if it's 25 then it's taken 120 minutes to take full charge. Not for gamers ..Pros- screen is good not face any screen flicker issue . One UI looks premium. Camera is good . Battery backup up is also very good. Not feel laggy , never try any games on it .If you are a day to day user not gamer then that's a good choice but charging time is only negative point I have .. if it's not a issue then go for it .. samsung one UI ois camera sAmoled Ex1380 in this price range.. that's a good deal (13700)

I bought this phone under 15k, at this price point getting a samsung phone with these feature is üëå,  I like the display quality very much and performance is also good at this price point not for gaming but for normal day to day tasks it is good. Camera quality is really good. So, from my side it is recommended to buy this phone.

A very good phone for the budget!!
","
I purchased the phone on its launch and received the product on 22nd of July 2024. The variant that I purchased was 8gb+256gb and got for a price of around ‚Çπ20,500 including all the offers and cashback. I have used this phone for almost 40 days now and here is my honest opinion and feedback.PROS:1. The display is brilliant and smooth as always and the auto brightness functionality works pretty well. Even in direct sunlight, the screen is visible and can be used without much trouble.2. Both the front and back cameras does it job beautifully, be it in terms of pictures as well as the videos.3. The stereo speaker is wonderfully loud and clear and the audio quality is excellent.4. The battery backup is amazing. I use Hotspot and Bluetooth for almost 7 hours in a day on a continuous and simultaneous basis but still have around 25 to 30 percent battery life at the end of the day.5. The best part of the phone is the One UI which is too good and is highly customizable according to our needs and wants.6. The promise of 4 OS updates and 5 years of security updates.7. The ram management in the phone seems pretty good. Even if many apps are running in the background the speed is good and does not tend to hang.8. There is no issues relating to connectivity and call drops which was observed in the older galaxy M models.Cons:1. The phone is big and single hand navigation is pretty difficult.2. The phone actually is a bit heavy in terms of weight. However, one you start using it you will get used to the same.3. They should have provided a fast charging brick in the box.4. The phone does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack and is kind of a let down.5. The phone heats up occasionally but also tends to cool down pretty fast.So, overall it is a good buy for people who want a good phone in a  decent budget for a regular use.

Not well optimised.
","
I usually buy Nokia mobiles ( windows,lumias, nokias). First time I touched a Samsung mobile. Physically it is sturdy. The Ram is not well optimized. I don't know whether it is software or hardware issue. Navigation programming is basic phone level. I never had that kind of experience in any other mobile. May be it is issue with this model. Hope upgrade will rectify it.

BEST phone under 15K
","
Bought this phone for Rs 13749 in the Great Indian Sale.Package does not include a charger, so keep that in mind.>>DESIGN: 7/10Nothing special, typical samsung design with 3 vertically stacked cameras.Display bezels are a bit thicker than the competition but they are uniform on all sides.Plastic back does not look good, no matter which color you choose, but a back cover solves that problem.>>DISPLAY : 10/10The best part about this device is the display, 1080p super amoled with punchy colors and great viewing angles. Samsung finally moved on from outdated U shaped notches and brought a punch hole.If you like viewing content then you are in for a treat. Display quality is comparable to what other brands offer in a segment above.>>SOUND: 9/10Dual speakers with dolby sound, ideal for media consumption. Upper speaker has a bit less volume compared to the bottom one, still it gives a good stereo effect.Sound is crisp, loud and clear.>>SOFTWARE : 10/10Another great aspect of this device. Well designed one ui with tons of features and device level optimizations. Bloatware is present, but can be uninstalled easily.Software support is just unbeatable : 4 major os updates and 5 years of security patches.One thing to note that goodlock is not available, but a lot of 3rd party workarounds are available.>>PERFORMANCE : 8/10Surprise, surprise. A well performing phone budget phone from samsung, isn't it great? Antutu scores are above 600k and real life performance is also good. I'm not a gamer , for me the performance is more than enough. no lags , no stutters and no app crashes.Phone doesn't heat up in normal usage and video calls, can't tell about gaming, coz I'm not a gamer.>>CAMERA : 9.5/10One of the best set of cameras available on any budget phone. PERIOD.50 MP main camera has OIS and clicks great photos with typical samsung colors and great details.8 MP ultrawide is good for occasional photography and making wide angle videos. Wish it was 13MP.2 MP macro is useless as always. Just don't know why manufacturers give it.13 MP Selfie camera is good, produces social media ready pictures.4k video capture is supported from both front and back cameras & you can also switch in between wide and normal lenses just like Iphones. OIS is not available in videos, but the EIS works well.>>BATTERY : 9/10Battery life is great, gives a screen on time of 8-9 hours on a single charge. Will easily last 2 days on medium usage and 1 full day on heavy usage. Charging is slow, even with the 25 watt charger that samsung sells for  Rs 999, it takes 1.5 hrs to charge fully. I'm getting 2 days backup with 5g turned on all the time and about an hour of video calls and some social media.>>VERDICT:Finally a great budget phone from Samsung that actually peforms well. Camera is great, display is beautiful, speakers are good , battery life is descent and software support is unmatched. Plus the brand value of samsung and knox safety along with it make this a great deal for people who do not game a lot.For gamers please choose some other device.

The phone is good for its price. The camera quality is okay, the speaker is excellent, and there's no doubt about Samsung's display quality. It looks bulky and heavy due to its large battery size.

A mixed bag of good, bad & ugly
","
So I used a pixel 6A before buying M35 and since both phones fall in the same price segment, my review is largely based on comparison between the two.The good:Display quality: aside from uneven bezels, the brightness, color quality and the touch response is amazing.Battery: Just Amazing, wonderful. I could go almost 3 days with low to moderate usage & an entire day with heavy usage.The Bad:Size: it's an extremely large phone so someone with smaller hands may fund it difficult to reach the ends of the screen.The Ugly:Sensors: All sensors in this phone are extremely bad. The adaptive brightness does not adapt at all & has to be manually changed when coming out of the room or into the sun.Pick to wake: Does not work at all. Have to double tap on the screen or use the button to wake up the screen.Comfort: Very little as the phone is extremely heavy, if held for over 10 minutes the arm starts aching.Performance: I bought the 8GB version just to ensure there's no lag but still the phone froze a few times and had to be restarted. Now I've set schedule to restart the phone every night automatically to avoid such situation again.In conclusion, the phone is wonderful if you are looking for a good display, decent performance & a great battery life.

Good phone for medium use, very slow charging, no charger with phone, quite heavy.
","
Bought this phone close to the Prime day sale. It came for around 19.5K, not with the best of discounts they offered.The packaging was minimum, but good. The phone is really heavy, may be due to the glass and battery. The Sumsung migrate application made the move very easy from my old (Samsung) phone. It didn't copy the Whatsapp chats and media though, I lost most of it when my old phone failed just a day later. I know Samsung migrate can't touch Whatsapp chat contents due to encryption used, but it would be good to have a solution for that. Loss of data is big.The phone came with 70% battery charge which was good enough to switch on and data migration. The charging takes a lot of time. The chargers which used to charge my old Samsung phone in fast charging mode aren't charging this phone the same way, its working in normal charging only. If the samsung knew this, they should have provided the charger with this phone also, its a major pain point for me.With single charge Im able to use the phone for 24 hours, which is good enough for a medium phone user like me. But for heavy gaming type users, this may not be suitable. So, study before buying this phone.At the moment, Im happy with the selection at this price point. Being heavy and missing charger are the main pain points.

I am writing this review after using 10 Days. Overall Rating 3.8/5For Display - 4/5 , Good vibrant display and colour accuracy was good and good visibility under direct sunlight. only cons is supports Upto 1440p HDR video in Youtube, but normal 2160P video will play without any lag. ( Don't believe fake paid youtuber videos, I'll also one of victim, They'll show only 2 sec snip with 2160P HDR, but it will crash automatically and coverts into Max 480p normal video)Battery - 4/5. 6000mAH- Gives more than 1 day for regular usage, but it will takes time to recharge 20% to 95% Upto 1hr 40 mins with Samsung 25w Charger.Weight distribution is well balanced and its easy to hold.Back Camera - In under Good lighting condition I'll give 4/5. But indoor condition is very poor I am giving rating only 2/5.Selfie Camera - Portrait shots was good. but OIS stabilization is not provided due to some photos came little bit shacky.Sound Quality is really loud and stereo speakers was good. But while watching full movie at full volume you may feel some ear pain due to high decibel. but for hearing songs it'll be good with Dolby Atmos even wireless condition.

Pros:- Great battery backup. With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector. So, need to shell out extra money for these.

Good enough OIS camera and image processing with 4k recording6. Exynos 1380 with 600k above antutu score7. 4 gen OS and 5 years security updates8. Dual sterio speakers9. Cornering gorilla glass victus plus10. Good quality 6.6"" sAMOLED display with decent brightness11. One UI 6.112. Latest Bluetooth, wifi and 5G..13. No heating issues and lags in everyday use or light gaming14. Photo remaster, background blur, object erase etc15. Samsung is reliableCons:1. Heavy and bulky (222 grams and 9 mm thick without case), but it is due to 6000 mAH battery and vapour cooling chamber2. Thick bezels (but uniform)3. No IPXX rating (it is expected in INR 20k priced phone)4. No charger in box and charging takes 1 hour 40 minutes from zero to 100% with 25 watt charger, type-C cable in box but length is short5. Not for heavy gamersThis review is after 25 days of use, I bought 8 GB, 256 GB for INR 22.5k including 2k bank discount..I suggest buyers to install tempered glass and case immediately after receiving the unit..

Amazing
","
It's works just as they advertised it .THE DISPLAY is really good , after all it's a SAMSUNG OLED panel , the colour and viewing angles are astonishing .THE SOUND is crisp it's not too loud , it's on the comforting side but it is very crisp and it has DOLBY ATMOS support for compatible songs and videos too .THE PERFORMANCE is very good at this price point , it's not a gaming phone you have to keep that in mind it's an all-around balanced phone that checks all the boxes ... in that sense day to usage the performance is really good and heating isn't an issue the vapour chamber does work well . It keeps the phone cool , however you can absolutely do light gaming on it ... performance is very stable and it doesn't throttle at all .THE CAMERA is good it takes sharp and detailed images in good conditions and even in low lights the shots are decent ... The colour science on all the 3 cameras (excluding the macro lens) is very consistent . Shots taken are good , portrait mode has decent edge detection . Pictures are vivid and punchy coloured (as expected from SAMSUNG tuning)... Selfie are crisp too skin is almost perfect as the vivids the tones a bit .THE BATTERY is big changes grade , you can't kill the phone even if you use it all day ... even on heavy usage the phone lasted about a bit short of 1.5 days for me . The charging is capped to 25w but you have to buy the charger separately... but charging speed is fine . No complains on that .THE BUILD is really good , yes it is plastic frame with acrylic back but it's sturdy af ... front is Corning's Victus+ that's the same on from my Galaxy S22 , it has tougher Crack resistance but it can scratch , so I recommend using a protector film or glass .Overall the experience is reallllly good for the price I paid for it (‚Çπ18499 for 8 ,128GB variant) I will highly recommend this if you want an all-around balanced phone .

So far so good
","
Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radIOS are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.

Though heavily hyped in social media platforms, bragged much about battery, SOT, camera and bla bla, its performance is nearly average. In camera, back side photography is not up to the mark, but in this price range, videography and selfie camera are good. Battery backup is average, I am getting 7-8 hours of SOT even in average use of YouTube, browser, and social media that's it, though people hyped saying "" iski battery khatam hi nahi hoti kitna hi use kar lo"".I am partially satisfied with it. Even my last used phone F12 clicks much better photos than this. Before F12 I was using M51 which was also one of the best phones in battery backup and camera.Bezels are very big verifying that it is a cheaper phone. Phone get heats up while charging idle. Took ages to charge when One Plus and other brands giving 100W charging support. Also, charger is very expensive, unlike the phone. But we  Samsung users are like "" noon roti khaenge par phone Samsung ka hi lenge, Theek Hai""I am satisfied with the pricing, I got in 47.60% discount from MRP in great India sales after returning my old phone though its screen was shattered but accepted.What to say but I can recommend only after seeing the pricing and when u don't care much about deeper things in the phone, suitable for our ""bade bujurg"" but not for choosy and techie type people.

If you know what to expect, this is a solid device !!
","
I was using the Moto G85 but my uncle needed to change his phone and he loved that phone so I decided getting this as I was using the M34 as my secondary device for my work.Very honestly, let me come clean, this phone will make sense to you if you know what you are getting into. For starters, this is without the doubt the best camera setup under 20K. The images are mostly of natural colors and good sharpness and details. The video capabilities are great too with 4K recording on both front and rear cameras. The video stabilisation is good too. However, the selfie camera and low light selfie images could have been better. I got the 6/128 model at 14K and at that price it is the best camera rear camera setup. An image taken on this camera has been attached for reference.The battery life is awesome. Expect a solid 7 hours SOT with 30 percent juice left under moderate use like YouTube, social media, music, a bit of camera use, Whatsapp and and a few calls on WiFi as well as 5G.The OS is just brilliant and I love One UI, I guess even more than stock Android. I have used Apple devices in the past and loved the experience and I can say the same for One UI. Also, Knox security is something you will always appreciate.And now the main question everyone would ask - what about Exynos? Well, in my honest opinion, the 1380 is much more optimized than the 1280 was in the M34. This chip handles daily tasks well. There are very little micro stutters mainly in animation and app switching, but that's about it. The phone does get warm but never overheats. The vapour cooling chamber works well. The CPU doesn't throttle much too. The Geekbench scores are impressive with approximately 1000 single core and 2800 multi core scores. I don't game so I can't answer for that. But overall this is a solid chip for daily usage.Now there is one thing I have a slight confusion about. The display is great with a punch hole, though the bezels are big. That isn't a huge concern to me but what bothered me initially is that the bezels made the phone much wider and slightly uncomfortable initially. I am used to it now. The display is a solid A+ though. Samsung's inhouse 120Hz sAMOLED is awesome. Just the brightness under direct sunlight is 1000 nits which might be a bit less for outdoor usage.The fingerprint reader is accurate if not the fastest. But the lack of IP is a thing to keep in mind. Use a good case to reduce chance of water damage. It should be fine, just don't dunk it in a lake.The stereo speakers sound good if not great. I felt it could have used a little more bass. But the Dolby Atmos support helps it a lot.Overall, what I feel is if you keep your expectations in check, this is a solid phone and perhaps the best phone if you can get it at 15K-17K price range for moderate use.

Display(9/10): 6.5inch may feel small but still it's good. The amoled is working perfectly giving vibrant colours(not natural). Resolution is 1080p.Build(7/10): This feels very boxy type and bulky but still acceptable. It has plastic so scratches are possible.Performance(8/10): While this phone isn't made for gaming but it deliveres good performance in casual gaming and daily use. Not recommended for hardcore gamersCamera(10/10): In this price range camera is of best quality. Photo looks more natural, the ois is working perfectly. The video quality isn't that good but acceptable.Network(10/10): It has all the 13 bands so it can use 5g at full speed. Till now no network issue is found from the phone.Disadvantages: It does not have a 3.5mm audio jack. Charger cable was only included and it supports only 25watt charging which is low and takes 1 hours 25 minutes to full charge( tested on 22.5 watt charger). Heating issue is very bad point for this phone. It doesn't have basic settings features like show connection speed,etc.

I purchased the phone on its launch and received the product on 22nd of July 2024. The variant that I purchased was 8gb+256gb and got for a price of around ‚Çπ20,500 including all the offers and cashback. I have used this phone for almost 40 days now and here is my honest opinion and feedback.PROS:1. The display is brilliant and smooth as always and the auto brightness functionality works pretty well. Even in direct sunlight, the screen is visible and can be used without much trouble.2. Both the front and back cameras does it job beautifully, be it in terms of pictures as well as the videos.3. The stereo speaker is wonderfully loud and clear and the audio quality is excellent.4. The battery backup is amazing. I use Hotspot and Bluetooth for almost 7 hours in a day on a continuous and simultaneous basis but still have around 25 to 30 percent battery life at the end of the day.5. The best part of the phone is the One UI which is too good and is highly customizable according to our needs and wants.6. The promise of 4 OS updates and 5 years of security updates.7. The ram management in the phone seems pretty good. Even if many apps are running in the background the speed is good and does not tend to hang.8. There is no issues relating to connectivity and call drops which was observed in the older galaxy M models.Cons:1. The phone is big and single hand navigation is pretty difficult.2. The phone actually is a bit heavy in terms of weight. However, one you start using it you will get used to the same.3. They should have provided a fast charging brick in the box.4. The phone does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack and is kind of a let down.5. The phone heats up occasionally but also tends to cool down pretty fast.So, overall it is a good buy for people who want a good phone in a  decent budget for a regular use.

I usually buy Nokia mobiles ( windows,lumias, nokias). First time I touched a Samsung mobile. Physically it is sturdy. The Ram is not well optimized. I don't know whether it is software or hardware issue. Navigation programming is basic phone level. I never had that kind of experience in any other mobile. May be it is issue with this model.

BEST phone under 15K
","
Bought this phone for Rs 13749 in the Great Indian Sale.Package does not include a charger, so keep that in mind.>>DESIGN: 7/10Nothing special, typical samsung design with 3 vertically stacked cameras.Display bezels are a bit thicker than the competition but they are uniform on all sides.Plastic back does not look good, no matter which color you choose, but a back cover solves that problem.>>DISPLAY : 10/10The best part about this device is the display, 1080p super amoled with punchy colors and great viewing angles. Samsung finally moved on from outdated U shaped notches and brought a punch hole.If you like viewing content then you are in for a treat. Display quality is comparable to what other brands offer in a segment above.>>SOUND: 9/10Dual speakers with dolby sound, ideal for media consumption. Upper speaker has a bit less volume compared to the bottom one, still it gives a good stereo effect.Sound is crisp, loud and clear.>>SOFTWARE : 10/10Another great aspect of this device. Well designed one ui with tons of features and device level optimizations. Bloatware is present, but can be uninstalled easily.Software support is just unbeatable : 4 major os updates and 5 years of security patches.One thing to note that goodlock is not available, but a lot of 3rd party workarounds are available.>>PERFORMANCE : 8/10Surprise, surprise. A well performing phone budget phone from samsung, isn't it great? Antutu scores are above 600k and real life performance is also good. I'm not a gamer , for me the performance is more than enough. no lags , no stutters and no app crashes.Phone doesn't heat up in normal usage and video calls, can't tell about gaming, coz I'm not a gamer.>>CAMERA : 9.5/10One of the best set of cameras available on any budget phone. PERIOD.50 MP main camera has OIS and clicks great photos with typical samsung colors and great details.8 MP ultrawide is good for occasional photography and making wide angle videos. Wish it was 13MP.2 MP macro is useless as always. Just don't know why manufacturers give it.13 MP Selfie camera is good, produces social media ready pictures.4k video capture is supported from both front and back cameras & you can also switch in between wide and normal lenses just like Iphones. OIS is not available in videos, but the EIS works well.>>BATTERY : 9/10Battery life is great, gives a screen on time of 8-9 hours on a single charge. Will easily last 2 days on medium usage and 1 full day on heavy usage. Charging is slow, even with the 25 watt charger that samsung sells for  Rs 999, it takes 1.5 hrs to charge fully. I'm getting 2 days backup with 5g turned on all the time and about an hour of video calls and some social media.>>VERDICT:Finally a great budget phone from Samsung that actually peforms well. Camera is great, display is beautiful, speakers are good , battery life is descent and software support is unmatched. Plus the brand value of samsung and knox safety along with it make this a great deal for people who do not game a lot.For gamers please choose some other device.

","
The phone is good for its price. The camera quality is okay, the speaker is excellent, and there's no doubt about Samsung's display quality. It looks bulky and heavy due to its large battery size. While there were some preinstalled apps, almost 90% of them can be easily uninstalled. Samsung is also promising 4 years of updates, making it a great phone overall in this price segment.

A mixed bag of good, bad & ugly
","
So I used a pixel 6A before buying M35 and since both phones fall in the same price segment, my review is largely based on comparison between the two.The good:Display quality: aside from uneven bezels, the brightness, color quality and the touch response is amazing.Battery: Just Amazing, wonderful. I could go almost 3 days with low to moderate usage & an entire day with heavy usage.The Bad:Size: it's an extremely large phone so someone with smaller hands may fund it difficult to reach the ends of the screen.The Ugly:Sensors: All sensors in this phone are extremely bad. The adaptive brightness does not adapt at all & has to be manually changed when coming out of the room or into the sun.Pick to wake: Does not work at all. Have to double tap on the screen or use the button to wake up the screen.Comfort: Very little as the phone is extremely heavy, if held for over 10 minutes the arm starts aching.Performance: I bought the 8GB version just to ensure there's no lag but still the phone froze a few times and had to be restarted. Now I've set schedule to restart the phone every night automatically to avoid such situation again.In conclusion, the phone is wonderful if you are looking for a good display, decent performance & a great battery life.

Good phone for medium use, very slow charging, no charger with phone, quite heavy.
","
Bought this phone close to the Prime day sale. It came for around 19.5K, not with the best of discounts they offered.The packaging was minimum, but good. The phone is really heavy, may be due to the glass and battery. The Sumsung migrate application made the move very easy from my old (Samsung) phone. It didn't copy the Whatsapp chats and media though, I lost most of it when my old phone failed just a day later. I know Samsung migrate can't touch Whatsapp chat contents due to encryption used, but it would be good to have a solution for that. Loss of data is big.The phone came with 70% battery charge which was good enough to switch on and data migration. The charging takes a lot of time. The chargers which used to charge my old Samsung phone in fast charging mode aren't charging this phone the same way, its working in normal charging only. If the samsung knew this, they should have provided the charger with this phone also, its a major pain point for me.With single charge Im able to use the phone for 24 hours, which is good enough for a medium phone user like me. But for heavy gaming type users, this may not be suitable. So, study before buying this phone.At the moment, Im happy with the selection at this price point. Being heavy and missing charger are the main pain points.

I am writing this review after using 10 Days. Overall Rating 3.8/5For Display - 4/5 , Good vibrant display and colour accuracy was good and good visibility under direct sunlight. only cons is supports Upto 1440p HDR video in Youtube, but normal 2160P video will play without any lag. ( Don't believe fake paid youtuber videos, I'll also one of victim, They'll show only 2 sec snip with 2160P HDR, but it will crash automatically and coverts into Max 480p normal video)Battery - 4/5. 6000mAH- Gives more than 1 day for regular usage, but it will takes time to recharge 20% to 95% Upto 1hr 40 mins with Samsung 25w Charger.Weight distribution is well balanced and its easy to hold.Back Camera - In under Good lighting condition I'll give 4/5. But indoor condition is very poor I am giving rating only 2/5.Selfie Camera - Portrait shots was good. but OIS stabilization is not provided due to some photos came little bit shacky.Sound Quality is really loud and stereo speakers was good. But while watching full movie at full volume you may feel some ear pain due to high decibel. but for hearing songs it'll be good with Dolby Atmos even wireless condition.

Samsung S23 Ultra ReviewS23 Ultra is a true powerhouse and an impressive flagship device. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key features and performance:Design & Build: The design is sleek and premium with a polished metal frame and glass back. It feels solid in hand, though it‚Äôs slightly heavier due to its large size. The curved edges and near-bezel-less display give it a modern, elegant look.Display: The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display is stunning. Colors are vibrant, blacks are deep, and it offers fantastic brightness even in direct sunlight. The 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling smooth and the overall experience buttery.Performance: Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset (or Exynos, depending on the region), this phone can handle anything you throw at it. Whether gaming, multitasking, or using heavy apps, the performance remains snappy without any lags.Camera: The highlight of the S23 Ultra is its camera setup. The 200MP main sensor captures incredible detail, and the photos in good lighting are rich and sharp. Low-light performance is also top-notch. The 10x optical zoom is another standout feature, allowing for clear shots from afar. It‚Äôs ideal for photography enthusiasts.Battery Life: With a 5000mAh battery, the S23 Ultra comfortably lasts a full day on moderate use. Even with heavy use, you can get through the day without needing a recharge. Fast charging and wireless charging are both supported, though it lacks the ultra-fast charging speeds seen in some competitors.Software: Running on Android 13 with Samsung‚Äôs One UI, the experience is smooth and highly customizable. Samsung has also committed to providing long-term software updates, which is a big plus for future-proofing the device.Verdict: The Samsung S23 Ultra is a premium device with a price tag to match, but it justifies the cost with its exceptional display, powerful performance, and top-tier camera capabilities. If you're looking for a flagship Android phone that excels in nearly every aspect, the S23 Ultra is a strong contender.Pros:Stunning AMOLED displayExceptional camera performanceStrong performance for gaming and multitaskingSolid battery lifeCons:Quite bulky and heavyExpensive

The best smartphone money can buy!
","
After using Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra for quite a bit as a daily driver and coming back to Samsung after a long time after using other smaller form factor phones like ONEPLUS 9, here's what I think about this phone.PROS:- This phone has the best camera ever installed into a smartphone, hands-down! No other phone made in human history can ever come close to 1% of what Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra's cameras can do.- Performance is crazy! Not only it has Snapdragon 8Gen-2, but that too custom-made for Samsung Galaxy phones. You can play any games, run any apps and do whatever you'd want from a phone that is used at work, gaming, taking photos/videos and for personal use at the same time.- Rectangular form factor of this phone makes it so much comfortable and easy to hold. And it looks very premium too, which obviously is expected from a phone that costs this much.- OneUI has so many great features that they cannot be listed in one place. It brings a whole new meaning to ""smart"" in smartphones. Previously only Apple was making real smartphones that were actually smart and now with OneUI 5.1, Samsung has joined the league and probably done a better job than Apple at this point.- Good Lock modules + OneUI 5.1 has such a tremendous level of customization in terms of many aspects of the usability. It doesn't have all of it, to which I'll come in ""CONS"" section.- Charging time is good, reverse charging and wireless charging are such a sweet add-on that helps and makes the experience really good.- S-Pen does the wonders! Very useful specially for those who use their phone for professional work like eSigning and other precision work.- Build quality and software are really premium, you'll know you've sold a kidney when you hold this phone in your hands and turn up the max resolution on display.- S23 Ultra is slightly more flat on sides as compared to S22 Ultra which makes it a more usable phone.CONS:- Now, since this phone has a curved display which adds no usability but makes it little difficult to use for people with smaller hands or to reach to corners with one hand, it becomes little hard to get used to this kind of display even if you've used a curved display phone with smaller form factor before because S23 Ultra is HUGE!- Another issue with curved screen, since there's a decent curve in screen, finding a screen protector is really hard! Tempered glasses don't fit well, they get spaced by covers/cases, Samsung officially doesn't make tempered glass for S23 Ultra. Samsung sells a thin membrane sheet for ‚Çπ1,500/- which has a cutout for camera and collects dust. Having no screen protection means having your second kidney at risk too!- No charger in the box (ugh) and the cable that comes with it is really flimsy. Doesn't look like it came with a flagship phone. ONEPLUS makes 10x better cables so better buy one from them.- A phone this expensive should have all the necessary features right? But the OneUI 5.1 doesn't come with an app lock. Samsung Secure Folder is nice but not usable for a day-to-day use. Secure Folder is fine for hiding images and apps but not convenient for daily access. There's no Good Lock module to have app lock either.- OneUI 5.1 (unlike many other UIs like OxygenOS 13 and ColorOS 13) doesn't give option to rename apps in app drawer. Ability to use 3rd party icon packs just came recently. And installing a 3rd party launcher kind of ruins the UI for recent apps screen.- OneUI 5.1 requires installation of a 3rd party Good Lock module to even configure what icons will appear on your navigation bar.- Overall this is a really good phone, best I'd say! But OneUI 5.1 lacks some basic features which should've been implemented.- But other than these minor software issues and some hardware inconveniences, this phone is definitely a recommendation.

Outstanding Phone with Phenomenal Camera and out of the league display
","
Have been using the phone for the 3 days, and can say only one word - Outstanding. Wide array of features, most of which will take a considerable amount of time to get explored. The camera setup is phenomenal, in love with the cameras, daylight photos are out of the league, night photos are also beautiful. A bit on the bigger side, but for me it's not much of a problem. Have been using the normal 25 watt charger for charging upto 80 % ( as recommended for longer battery life) and takes around 1hr 15 mins for the same. Upon moderate usage will last for more than 24 hours. The UI is buttery smooth, the ease of using is much frinendlier, snapdragon runs like Formula 1. Sound output is fantastic too. Samsung displays are the best, and this is no exception, colour production is top notch and punchy, it's eye soothing too.Currently using Spigen Optik Armour back cover alongwith a normal matte finish screen protector. And yes, fingerprint doesn't work with normal Tempered glass, can't speak of UV ones.Very very satisfied with the phone, seems like a gadget with which I can easily spend years and yet remain pleased with its cool vibe.

Exceptional Performance, Stunning Display, and Outstanding Camera!
","
I recently upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, and it's been a fantastic experience. The phone is incredibly fast, thanks to its top-tier processor and ample RAM. Multitasking is seamless, and even the most demanding apps run without a hitch.The display is stunning, with vibrant colors and sharp detail, making it perfect for watching videos or playing games. The 120Hz refresh rate makes everything feel smooth and responsive.The camera is where this phone truly shines. The 200MP main camera captures exceptional detail, even in low light, and the zoom capabilities are unreal. I can zoom in from far distances and still get clear, usable shots. The S Pen is another standout feature, making it easier to take notes, navigate, and even edit photos.The battery life is solid, lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use, and fast charging is a lifesaver when I need a quick top-up.Overall, the S23 Ultra is an all-around powerhouse that excels in performance, display quality, and photography. It‚Äôs definitely worth the investment if you're looking for a premium smartphone. Highly recommended!

my experience of using the S23 ultra for 1 onth
","
I had switched to the S23 Ultra from the iPhone 13. For me, the S23 Ultra is in a different league compared to the iPhone 13. The cameras are so much better and the telephoto lens of the phone also adds an interesting and useful component to the phone. even when gaming, it gives me 120 fps in most of the games. the display is fantastic and even the charging is adequately fast and reliable. (you need to buy the 45w charger separately.) apart from that, the speakers are fantastic and the haptic feedback is great too. The only major downside I found is that it heats a little bit while you play heavy games and the phone charges slowly while being used. overall, if you can get this phone below 85k now, definitely go for it as it almost has no difference compared to the S24 ultra. The battery backup is also great and 1.5 charging cycles lasts me the entire day. (my average SOT is 10-14 hours). The S pen is also quite handy and is useful occasionally. I would say this is the best all-rounder Android phone you can get if you're looking for a phone below the 100k barrier. Also, the phone will get updates till Android 17 so there is no worry of the OS falling back in time and will run you a good 3 years even if you buy the phone now. Remember that the phone is huge and only buy it if you're comfortable with this form factor or this phone may render as useless to you. go for the regular s23 models if you're not a hardcore user but if you have the budget and requiremnts of the features in this phone i would 100% recommend this phone to you.

Great purchase in Amazon festival sales. Initially hesitated to invest that money too on phone.. but once you use it, you will come to know why it is 70000!!!... Great camera, great Display, awesome S pen and many AI features of One UI..also decent battery.. but major downside is curved display in my personal opinion.. because phone with curved displays are not safe in case of accidental fall and no practical use from it also..I don't play much games but I tried BGMI.. worked very well without any lag with stunning visuals..

Well nothing but the best purchase I have made

I finally got the s23 ultra in the Amazon sale. It's a wonderfull device and one of the best for productivity and overall use. The camera is extraordinary. I am someone who doesn't change their phone regularly and uses one phone for more than 4 years so I got this as a phone that I can rely on the long run. Overall from Charging speed, sound quality, camera  and storage capacity it is value for money. The s-pen is a good add on surprise that once u learn about it's usage it's fun and very useful.

Smooth Upgrade | Flagship is üî•

Overall build quality is amazing, I upgraded from OnePlus 9RT and trust me it feels little heavy at first but once you get used to it, will be as a butter.Camera is just amazing, display is üî•.There are literally so many options and features in the phone that I am still unable to browser it all.Only drawback is the fingerprint which is not good after applying tempered glass on the screen.battery life is still amazing, connectivity is perfect with all ecosystem, there is no major heating issues as such even after playing high spec BGMI.Overall it is value for money in this deal.

Overall excellent mobile but i dont know why i feel like camera was not up to my expectation
","
I ordered my mobile in great indian sale at 75k and got one day delivery. Phone look and experience is more than satisfying. Every thing feels premium. But the only reason im giving a four star is because when i saw some youtube reviews about this mobile camera was better. I dont know why but it seems like i. Reality it is not as good as in the reviews

‚Ä¢ Price: The S23 Ultra is undeniably expensive, positioning itself as a luxury device. ‚Ä¢ Size: While the large display is fantastic for content consumption, it might be too big for users who prefer compact phones. ‚Ä¢ Charger Not Included: As with many flagship phones nowadays, you will need to purchase the fast charger separately, which is disappointing for some buyers.ConclusionThe Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is a powerhouse, excelling in almost every aspect, from its vibrant display to its impressive camera system and robust performance. It‚Äôs a phone that caters to power users, creatives, and anyone who values cutting-edge technology. While the price is steep, for those seeking a device that does it all, the S23 Ultra is hard to beat.

This Phone is good but too bulky for daily use. Camera is ok but not as good as expected. Battery life is good. My budget Moto Edge 50 Fusion feels much more comfortable than this.

I got the mobile and its fantastic. For some reason, seller decided to ship the product through the slowest speed possible. It was showing delivery in 2 days before ordering. Then it changed to 3-5 days while paying. And only got delivered the last day. I would say that seller has made my purchase experience a near disaster.Charging speed is moderate. You will need 45w pd charger supporting pps for getting max speed. I am using amazon basics 45w charger. It shows super fast charging 2.0, But still charging way less slower. More than a hour to charge up to 100%.Display is fantastic. Sound quality is real nice.. Feels heavier in hand. Its obvious because it is a big phone.Camera üíØüëåFeel üíØLove this phone.

I switched from Iphone 13, and realized what all things i was missing while using useless IOS.Honestly, IOS doesn't have anything interesting for the tech geek like us, it is used for simplest UI and functionalities.I believe IOS is only made for the old age people who just want to use call functionalities.Talking about this Beast Samsung S23 Ultra, I'm still in process of identifying all its features. Trust me, everyday I'm discovering something new/interesting in it, and that makes my purchase worth !!!

I purchased this device during a sale for 70k with no-cost EMI. I must say, this device handles daily tasks effortlessly. The memory management is excellent too. My previous device was a mid-range model, so upgrading to a high-end device, I can definitely feel the performance boost. The camera and battery are impressive as well. I plan to use this device for at least 3 to 4 years since Samsung's update policy will keep the software up to date. In one word: simply brilliant

Size takes time to get used to...4. Stylus is not everyone's cup...would be used minimally at best...Overall got same VFM from Z Flip 3 at much lower price of 49k...so think twice. Mine was an impulse purchase....Recommend research as almost similar performance is available at lower price...Cheers!!

It is a great phone to buy during the festivals. The sound quality is good. I am using a 25W charger and it charges good. It has a lot more customisations than an iPhone.However, the Warranty extension that can be bought from the Samsung official and the Accidental and Liquid damage protection plan are very high.Also, it is NOT worth buying at any value greater than 1 lakh. Wait for sale, or wait till the value drops below 1 lakh. Even less than 90k.

Considered it only for the good camera features, brand, the deal price 75K with card offers and 12 months no cost EMI offer which made it as affordable. And considering all the features available in it, still have a question if I will be using them all - surely no.Main problem that I see is the service cost in future on getting any compliant after the warranty period. I may be forced to buy new mobile rather than replacing the spares.So far happy to own this, only concern was delivery, recently the delivery team was not doing a good job at my place. One star down for that.

The camera sees the introduction of a new 200MP sensor, up from the 108MP resolution of Ultras past. The couple of telephotos remain a staple of the lineup and a standout feature in the market where 10x optical zoom is nowhere to be found outside of the Samsung offerings.

For me my routine tasks can be satisfied more than by S23 ultra and no requirement for  S24 ultra with huge price margin.

Good phone for the price. Works flawlessly when you extend ram 4+4 GB.Simple HIOS launcher is basic. Both Camera are basic, but works quite well. Sound is loud and clear. Charging is dead slow, you have to plug it overnight as recommended by the manufacturer. Heating is very less compared to my previous mi note 7.Charger is provided in the box, transparent case also. Thin screen guard already applied.It detects external memory card 128 GB, but after  2 days it says card is corrupted,do you want to format now. But the card can be read in other phones without formatting. Some bug here. Overall worth the price.

Nothing is branded. Quality makes company branded. One day this company also will be a brand.

It's a bore phone, it has all sensors but no option to use them. Like gesture to double tap and wake or lock screen is missing, app lock is missing, the dynamic port is active only for notifications else it vanishes. It has custom UI but it needs alot of development. Camera is average, when you zoom the picture tears no clarity. They really need to buckup. These small small features are the aesthetics that customers look for in a phone and surprisingly inspite of all the features there we can't use them. Bore phone, won't recommend. 3 stars for Android T.Also it's battery life is average, if you are a heavy user you'll have to plug in charger after half day.

TECNO POVA 6 NEO Disappointing Specs and Performance for ‚Çπ13,999 ‚ÄîNot Worth the Investment
","
Buying the TECNO POVA 6 NEO for ‚Çπ13,999 feels like a waste, especially with the misleading claims about the AI camera. The phone only supports 16 AI-generated photos and doesn‚Äôt offer 4K video recording. It has a 108MP rear camera, but no additional lenses, limiting its ability to take different types of photos. The front camera pictures also lose quality when zoomed in, which isn‚Äôt great.On top of that, the phone doesn‚Äôt have Gorilla Glass or any other protective screen, making it easy to scratch. Even though it has a 5000mAh battery, it doesn‚Äôt last a full day, and the 18W charging is slow, with noticeable heating issues when charging.The camera doesn‚Äôt perform well in low light, so night photography is disappointing. The phone also heats up during gaming, which affects its performance. Without Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), videos aren‚Äôt very stable, especially when moving or shooting handheld.The 6.67-inch LCD screen, with a resolution of 1600x720 pixels (HD+), is below average, and it doesn‚Äôt look as clear as other phones in this price range. Even though TECNO claims the phone has a 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling through apps like YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook feels laggy after using it for a while.TECNO also advertises a 12-month OTTPlay subscription with a scratch code included in the box, but the code doesn‚Äôt work after just a month, which is frustrating.The phone has dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, but the sound during WhatsApp video calls or on loudspeaker isn‚Äôt as loud as expected. For the price, this kind of quality just isn‚Äôt good enough.

It's a nice 5G phone
","
Battery Backup : excellent (approx. 1 and a half days)Battery Charging : it took 70 minutes to go from 18% to 87% i.e. 69% charging in 70 minutes by an 18 watt charger. Turbo charge feature is not available in this device. The device heats while charging.Storage : 8 GB + 256 GB (Excellent at this price)Display : it's good but not Amoled.Processor : Dimensity 6300. Till now it is working great. Can play games easily without any lag.Sound : it's good and loud as it has two speakers one at the top side  and other at the bottom side.Camera is good at this price. But don't expect too much.Build quality : Nice, I mean upto the mark in my opinion.

Ram management
","
The ram management of the phone is extremely poor, 45 percent of ram is used without any apps, and after uninstalling all the unnecessary apps. Just had some office app and whatsapp which comes about 80 % of ram, even after virtual ram of 8 gb. Its just seems my old 4 gb ram phone... The ads seems misleading.... The askAI features seems useful... But thanks to the freezer app... I was to save much ram..  to work finely... AI features it profess, it has to be used going to setting each time... Otherwise, the features and camera are useful for day today use.

its charging speed is very slow in 30 minutes it only charged from 57% to 69% i think it should charge faster as i  had saw a comment saying that it charged from 10 to 100 in about 2 hours it gets discharge at okay rate about 10 to 15 min for 1 charge  it has dimensity 6300 as its processor has 3 ram modes 2,5,8gb and has 256 rom , android 14 . Overall i will say its okay for its value if you a budget of more than 15000 then you should take a poco as it will have a good processor as well as a fast charging speed

After 3 weeks of heavy usage, I'm fully satisfied with this phone... The battery hasn't drained out at all despite charging the phone for about 15-20 mins a day... The camera is brilliant... Looks premium... There are some unnecessary pre installed apps that can be easily deleted unlike other Chinese brands that load a lot of malware... Other than a sleek cover, there is also a protective glass for the display screen... Overall, much more than value for money!!
