iphone 15,"***BUYERS WITH SKEPTICAL ANXIETY*** Lets start by saying the review i am about to leave will be my best one to date with tons of detail I spent literally about a week searching for phones that had been refurbished and sold on amazon. You can see that if you click on a specific phone then scroll down alittle there will be the same phone for sale but in different conditions. Most likely these other conditioned phones come from different companies. I seen alot of reviews about people getting scammed and or getting defective phones while scrolling through all the reviews for these companies starting from 1star to about 3 stars. (Obviously 4-5 stars will sell you on the product) after many hours on my venture for phones the one company that seemed to stand out was network store. The bad reviews they had was majorly from late delivery. For some reason these boys like to use FedEx and thats okay with me. I orded my first one and got it a day and a half later which was technically a day early from the original delivery date. When i opened the package to check the phone it was in great shape. There was afew minor issues but nothing for me to truly complain about considering the price. Once i started the hello screen and setting up the data transfer i noticed i got all the way to the end then the update on the new phone crashed.. i reset both phone in hopes that it would reset the transfer and update. I was wrong! It crashed the new phone i had got and during the transfer it disconnected my sim card from my other phone. I had two phones with no service! It was late that night so i woke up the next day and took the new phone to apple to get help or an explanation how to fix. They said they could help but they needed to plug the phone in to their repair laptop. I agreed then after plugging the phone in they realized the port of the phone was damaged and needed to be replaced which can cost anywhere from 300-700$ !!!! Grasping for both phones with anxiety and frustration i left the store and immediately went to a tech store to see what they would charge and they quoted the same. I went to my phone carrier to get another sim card which costed me $10 so i could have service again. then started the process of getting a refund on the amazon app. Amazon’s customer service reached out the the company to notify them of the issue and they confirmed i should hear back from the seller within 48hours. I eventually heard from the company and told them the issue. They immediately send a prepaid label to send the phone back to them in which i did that same day. 2 days later i received another 15 pro max 512gig black titanium phone that is nothing less than excellent shape. After a 16 hour data transfer i am now able to sit here and say these boys are the truth. They corrected a defective product with a even better one and didn't overly press about it. I can say i will be book marking this company in particular when it comes to buying anything refurbished again. I hope this can give someone an idea of the integrity they have. I will not deny that it was not an easy process and yes i did lowkey freak out thinking i was out of 950$ but they came through. The next best thing i can tell you is please do your research when it comes to jumping from an older phone or just a newer phone in general. I went from a 11pro max to a 15 pro max and the process of eliminating the physical sim card put me in a real bind. Last but not least, UPDATE THE PHONE FIRST!!!!!!!! After you update it then you can reset the phone then start the data transfer process. If all else fails you have to connect the phone to a laptop in DFU mode then manually update it. With the first phone i got i could have updated it first then loaded all my stuff on it and never knew the port had an issue. But since i did figure it out that means i couldn’t manually update it to fix the crashed out phone i got the first time. Once again thanks for correcting this. I cannot wait to take pictures and videos with my daughter this summer with my new phone. Read more",Amazon Store 2,"01:28 AM PKT, Sunday, May 25, 2025"
iphone 15,"I’ve used a lot of cases over the years, but what drew me to this one was the clarity. I went with the clear back and black trim, and it really does a great job of showing off the phone underneath. If you’re someone who actually likes the way your iPhone looks and doesn’t want to cover it up with something bulky or loud, this strikes a great balance. It’s slim, easy to snap on, and works with every wireless charger and magnetic accessory I’ve tested. The magnetic ring alignment felt secure and strong enough to work with everything from desk stands to car mounts. That’s something a lot of clear cases claim to do, but this one actually follows through. From a protection standpoint, it’s not in the same league as a heavy-duty case like an OtterBox, but it does have a raised edge around the screen and the camera bump, which helps with scratches and everyday bumps. It’s a good middle ground—more coverage than a fashion case, less bulk than a tank. If you’re looking for something that protects the phone while letting its natural design stay front and center, this is a solid pick. It’s simple, clean, and it doesn’t hide the reason you picked that phone in the first place. Read more",Amazon Store 3,"01:28 AM PKT, Sunday, May 25, 2025"
iphone 15,"So I didn’t realize the phone came with a screen protector, I kept putting on new ones and there were bubbles under it…. lol. I didn’t expect it to come with a screen protector tbh. So after realizing the phone actual screen didn’t have a bubble under it I was very relieved. And the original screen protector is pretty tight so it’s hard to notice. It barely fits with my otter box defender case. But everything is in working order so far. Camera is good. Had to activate the eSIM since I phone 14 and up don’t have a physical SIM card. It’s doable in hand when you get the phone when you purchase the unlocked version. I set all that up and updated the phone. And so far so good. Phone was in really good condition when I got it. Much better than my old phone through backpacker. Battery life gas been amazing too. Can’t say every phone is going to be this quality but hopefully they are. I think wireless source is who “renews” these phones, and they go through a 30 point inspection asa ell as a plug in diagnostic test I believe. If everything is good. Then it’s listed as renewed and is re sold. I’d say take the chance and grab one because it saved me all of money then buying a new phone. And the 14 should be supported until 2029 I think. That’s what I went with was the I phone 14. Good luck!",Amazon Store 4,"01:28 AM PKT, Sunday, May 25, 2025"
